More importantly, Unlike a # charity organisation, the government of # Australia is entirely in control of how many Australian dollars they spend, and when, and on what, and how often. Anything that can be purchased in Australian dollars, our federal government can pay it if they choose to, whenever they choose to, there is *nothing* stopping federal government from doing that. So it's a shameful abdication of duty, for our federal government to refuse to spend whatever dollars are needed to, for example, house every person in the country; while also expecting praise for recommending *we* (with leftover funds) give money to *charity organisations* (with less capacity to use it than government) instead. @ amonkeyinsilk # EndHomelessnessNow # PovertyIsAPolicyChoice # AusGov # AusPol",Night,Thursday,0.028888888888888898,positive,Hobart,"-42.882137,147.327195",bignose@theblower.au,0,0,https://theblower.au/@bignose/113597683425921381

That's why you often see negative prices in the middle of the day - solar earns renewable energy certificates that have value even if they have to pay to send energy into the grid, so will bid a negative price up to the value they'll earn from the certificate. That means that nuclear will be bidding at say $300/MWh and won't be dispatched. They won't be price setting.
