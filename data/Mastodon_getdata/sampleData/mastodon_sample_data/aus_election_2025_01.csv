The only thing I don’t like about the comments here is the focus on fires that had a direct impact on livelihoods. There have been several recent fires that didn’t directly affect communities. But it proved that regions that have never experienced fires for tens and hundreds of years are now at risk. https://www. sbs.com.au/news/article/what-t he-hell-is-going-on-top-firefighters-warning-for-australian-cities-after-la-fires/7az9gydpj # AusPol # QldPol # NSWPol # VicPol # TasPol # SAPol # WAPol # NTPol # ACTPol # ClimateCrisis # EmergencyManagement # FireFighting,Night,Wednesday,-0.010526315789473684,negative,Hobart,"-42.882137,147.327195",ki_sekiya@aus.social,6,0,https://aus.social/@ki_sekiya/113829852177243001

The object of employing children is not to train them, but to get high profits from their work."" -- Lewis Hine, 1908 “Lewis Hine, a New York City schoolteacher and photographer, believed that a picture could tell a powerful story. He felt so strongly about the abuse of children as workers that he quit his teaching job and became an investigative photographer for the National Child Labor Committee. Hine traveled around the country photographing the working conditions of children in all types of industries. He photographed children in coal mines, in meatpacking houses, in textile mills, and in canneries. He took pictures of children working in the streets as shoe shiners, newsboys, and hawkers. In many instances he tricked his way into factories to take the pictures that factory managers did not want the public to see. He was careful to document every photograph with precise facts and figures. To obtain captions for his pictures, he interviewed the children on some pretext and then scribbled his notes with his hand hidden inside his pocket.” — The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration. https://www. archives.gov/education/lessons /hine-photos",Evening,Wednesday,0.10370766488413546,positive,Sydney,"-33.868820,151.209296",LauraJG@deacon.social,0,0,https://deacon.social/@LauraJG/113834351072032682
