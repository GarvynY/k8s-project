Margaret Rose Preston (29 April 1875 ‚Äì 28 May 1963) was one of the leading Australian artists of her time. After travelling to Europe, her great artistic project was to foster an Australian ""national art"". One that borrowed *heavily* from Aboriginal Western Desert ""dot painting"" art styles (along with post-Impressionists like C√©zanne, Gauguin, and Matisse). She won acclaim for this style at a time before Aboriginal people had the right to vote, while the Australian Frontier Wars and Stolen Generations were still ongoing. Following her death Trevor Nickolls, a Ngarrindjeri artist from the Western Desert, painted ""Homage to Margaret Preston"". In the process, he reappropriated Preston's ""national art"" style. #art #painting #auspol #AusArt #Sydney #NSW #Australia #culture",Morning,Wednesday,0.09777056277056277,positive,Canberra,"-35.280937,149.130009",ajsadauskas@pixelfed.social,7,0,https://pixelfed.social/p/ajsadauskas/792716754777606063

114010044998248573,2025-02-15T21:33:43+00:00,"may not care. But it seems obvious that the public does. It has been political indifference for integrity, transparency and accountability that is helping to inspire rejection of the major parties. Both, and at once. There is a good deal less movement from major party to major party, because one is seen as being as bad as the other. That is not because the public fails to recognise different economic and moral philosophies in the mainstream parties. It is that they have concluded that these differences are minor compared with the common propensities to put their own interests ahead of the public's. In 2021, Labor was hungry for power after being in opposition for three terms. The Coalition, by contrast, had shown itself corrupted by incumbency and devoted to punishing its enemies and, particularly, rewarding its friends, donors, cronies and each other. The public appetite for change was about throwing out people who had been there too long for any good they were doing. But it was also because both the Liberals and the Nationals were seen to be under the influence of crooks. Labor, by contrast, was initially a refreshing change. But its want of zeal, its limited agenda, its timidity and unwillingness to offend any Labor constituencies means it has failed to cultivate friends among voters. Especially ones with a passion for honest, ethical and decent government. Bad big parties have created the space for motivated groups and individuals to force change when the big parties do not win majorities. Generally this leads to better government, not worse. One cannot judge easily which major party has the stronger urge to get things right, to do the right thing, to be concerned for appearances and to be a jealous steward of public resources. The fact is neither seems to care much. Politicians think they understand the public's cynicism and contempt. But they seem to think it does not matter much because both parties are equally guilty. I expect that independents and the Greens will do better this year, possibly holding the combined vote of Labor and Liberal to under 55 per cent. Labor is doing its best to help them in this task. Anthony Albanese has done all he can to remind people that the Labor Party has become a creature of organised gambling, of the commercial media industry, and lobbyists for infrastructure and Big Australia projects. Labor cooperates with the Coalition to keep the independents at bay, primarily by giving itself ever-increasing sums from the public purse, and depriving the little guys, those less able to compete. Albanese showed his will in the matter from the beginning by denying independents the old share of staff. He made it seem a virtue with public money, but in days after he has perpetuated the inequalities while bolstering his own staffing entitlements. His extra staff have not improved his political nous. By contrast reduced staff inhibits the capacity of independents to be across the important issues. Abuses such as these treat voters as mugs. Labor seems unembarrassed by its little (as it sees it) villainies. But they could become the issue if the teals hammer integrity in government and the need to hold the balance of power. They have the perfect formula for giving Labor a great big kick in the bum. Jack Waterford is a former editor of The Canberra Times.

How did we end up having to choose between such flops? There‚Äôs a word that sums up Australian politics at the moment very aptly. Veteran economic journalist and editor Ross Gittins, who has watched public policy and the people who make it for nearly half a century, wrote about the dirty deal between Labor and the Coalition on political funding last week, noting ‚ÄúWhen the chips are down, the duopolists must stick together and put their mutual interests ahead of the voters‚Äô right to choose. If you want proof that our politicians put their own careers way ahead of their duty to the people who vote for them, this is it. I‚Äôve never felt more disillusioned.‚Äù Disillusionment is right. Disillusionment with the major parties and with the self-serving nature of the political system the major parties control. We seem set for another spike in the level of minor party and independent support at the coming election. Much of this disillusionment centres on Anthony Albanese. He was never going to maintain the high levels of support he enjoyed in his extended honeymoon phase in the first half of the parliamentary term. We always expect too much of new prime ministers. But that has given way to a resentment ‚Äî that he‚Äôs so much less than he promised. The one-time left-wing firebrand has become an overly cautious, managerialist prime minister scared of his own shadow. Worse, he has proven as beholden to fossil fuel interests as the Coalition, and his signature idea is a manufacturing fantasy rooted in the 1970s. Albanese‚Äôs leadership of the ALP was born in the scarring experience of the 2019 election, when Labor went in heavy favourites to defeat Australia‚Äôs worst-ever prime minister, Scott Morrison, and came off second best courtesy of attacks on Bill Shorten and Chris Bowen‚Äôs ambitious reform program. Ever since, Labor has been resistant to any kind of major reform that might generate political blowback. Albanese‚Äôs strategy has been to use caution and moderation to secure multiple terms in government in order to bed down Labor reforms. Problem is, those reforms have been few and far between, and it looks like Albanese may end up leading the first single-term government since before WW2. Peter Dutton, in contrast, is a novel kind of Liberal leader. He‚Äôs not a Liberal at all but a Queensland LNP politician, and it shows ‚Äî he‚Äôs abandoned the free market, small government shibboleths of the NSW and Victorian Liberals who have dominated the party since the 1980s and embraced big government intervention in energy and threatened to use divestment powers against large corporations. But he‚Äôs also an overt racist, a peddler of conspiracy theories and fantasies about the threats posed by migrants, an opponent of climate action, and a dedicated culture warrior who has made exploiting social division within Australia his primary political technique. The effect is a double disenfranchisement of moderate Liberal voters who believe in the importance of climate change and centrist social values, and of economic liberals, who are now politically homeless. Much is made of Dutton‚Äôs apeing of Trump, correctly, and the Trump effect is one of the reasons we‚Äôve ended up with such a rotten choice at the coming election. Trump has legitimised and normalised attacks on key democratic institutions and the dramatic coarsening in public life. While calls for ‚Äúcivility‚Äù in politics are a clich√© and politicians of all stripes have long lied to us, standards of discourse in politics are significantly lower than they used to be because so many politicians ‚Äî usually on the right ‚Äî have seen what Trump not only gets away with but benefits from, and copy him. But some of the reasons for the hopeless state of major party politics are homegrown. The reluctance to fix the tax system so that it can fund the level of government we want is partly down to timid politicians ‚Äî everyone remembers 2019 ‚Äî but also reflects the grubby, self-centred nature of economic ‚Äúdebate‚Äù in the media, which is dominated by vested interests like big business and older, wealthy asset owners, and the fact that any genuine reforms that are in the public interest but harm powerful players will become the subject of politically toxic scare campaigns. The housing crisis and the bipartisan lack of climate action similarly reflect the inability of the media to properly hold the powerful to account on the most important issues facing Australia. This goes to the nature of our media ‚Äî oligopolistic, corporate, unrepresentative. News Corp and Seven are permanent allies of the Coalition (and attack dogs against Liberal moderates, as Malcolm Turnbull discovered). Nine regularly produces quality public interest journalism in its newspapers but its television network is a devoted supporter of powerful interests. The ABC remains cowed from long years of thuggery by the Coalition, with only its current affairs staff up to the task of meeting its legislated duty to provide news and information that is accurate and impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Most of our media are characterised by a lack of diversity and act as handmaidens to power, not watchdogs. To return to Gittins‚Äô point, there‚Äôs one other group that deserves blame for our current malaise: the Labor and Liberal parties. Individual politicians like Albanese and Dutton will come and go, but the party machines live on eternally, and we have allowed them to embed themselves deep into our systems of power. We allow them to enrich themselves from the public purse with funding for every vote (and we rightly make voting compulsory, thus maximising that funding). We allow them to carve out exemptions for themselves in areas such as privacy. We allow them to get away with disguising who is seeking to influence them. And we‚Äôve just strengthened the power of incumbency by allowing them to cap campaign spending for independent candidates while parties enjoy far bigger national campaign budgets. The poor choice at the coming election is one that‚Äôs been decades in the making. Disillusionment is the only sensible reaction.

And many would say we are going to an election far too quickly - hardly time for a government get its feet under the desk. It is nearly half a century since an unelected representative of the British Crown sacked a government and Prime Minister (Gough Whitlam) elected by the people less than two years before and installed the leader of the opposition (Malcolm Fraser) as prime minister. In that half century, political paralysis has prevented a dispassionate look at how governments are formed and dissolved in Australia and whether those arrangements are adequately detailed and appropriately democratic. It is good time to look at our constitutional arrangements which will have to deal with the hung Parliament, no matter what. The only post-war minority government in Australia was that led Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd from 2010 to 2013. Most people assume that, if both Labor and the Coalition fall short of a majority, one or other of them would stitch up enough independent or minor-party MPs to pledge confidence and supply and the leader of that party would head to Government House to be sworn in. That's what happened in 2010. There were six independent and minor-party MPs. The Green Adam Bandt and independent Andrew Wilkie were certain to go with Labor, so Labor prime minister Julia Gillard only needed two of the other four. She convinced them to support her. Similarly, in 1941 it took only two independents to support Labor's John Curtin for him to form a government. But now things are much different. In 2022, 16 independent and minor-party MPs were elected. In 2025, given low polling numbers for the major parties, that is likely to rise considerably. Any leader of a major political party would have trouble herding those cats into a supply-and-confidence deal. The position is further complicated by the fact that at least one of those cats will not be herded - Andrew Wilkie. He said last year: ""I learned that if you have a deal, you're locked in, and you are kind of taken for granted. Whereas, if you don't have a deal, you can't be taken for granted."" Wilkie said he would go to this election telling voters that he would not do a deal with either major party if there was a hung parliament, citing the broken agreement with Gillard on gambling-law reform. He has a point. Here we are 15 years later with Labor still beholden to the gambling ""industry"". He has spoken to the teal independents about those lessons. He thought there was no need for supply-and-confidence deals because crossbench MPs could always vote on a no-confidence motion in the House of Representatives to determine if a party and its leader could govern. ""I think it's democracy at its purest - that things are decided on the floor of the parliament,"" he said. ""If there is no majority, then someone brings on a no-confidence motion and let's find out where the numbers lie."" That is all soundly argued, but we need to go further. We should not be talking about just votes of no confidence; we should be talking about votes of confidence. We should be talking about changing the way governments are ""formed"" to ensure they are elected. At present the constitution gives the unelected Governor-General the power (unfettered by any words in the constitution) to appoint ministers to run a government. The term ""prime minister"" does not appear in the constitution. The constitution also gives the Governor-General the power (unfettered by any words in the constitution) to all elections. The powers are, of course, fettered by custom and practice which means the Governor-General will always appoint the leader of the party which wins a majority of seats in the House of Representatives (if that happens) to ""form"" a government and therefore be prime minister and will call an election when that prime minister asks for it. But what if there is no clear majority? The 2010 experience tells us the Governor-General will appoint a party leader who can demonstrate they have a majority. But after the next election that might be difficult to impossible. How much simpler would it be to extrapolate from Wilkie's position and apply the post-election rules that govern the ACT at the federal level? The ACT does not have an equivalent of a governor or administrator who acts as the Monarch's representative to ""call"" upon a party leader to ""form"" a government. Rather, in the ACT, after an election, the Electoral Commission certifies who has been elected as a member of the parliament. The first meeting of the parliament after an election is presided over by the Clerk of House and the first piece of business (with anything else out of order) is to elect a Speaker. The Speaker then presides over the House and the next piece of business (with everything else out of order) is the election of a Chief Minister, or in the case of Federal Parliament, the election of the Prime Minister. That is democracy. Then you add to that set up a parliamentary rule that you cannot have a no-confidence motion in a government unless the motion names the new prime minister. That way, the unelected Governor-General never has to call upon anyone to ""form"" a government or decide whether an election should be called. It would obviate the possibility that a prime minister, defeated on the floor of the House, could angle for an election rather than a handover of power. And it would force all those independents to make a decision. As for extending the term of governments, a great start would be to fix the term of the government at three years (because far too many have run short of that) with a fixed election date on, say, the last Saturday in November every three years. The senators' terms would be two terms of the House. Going for four-year terms would have advantages, but it would mean eight-year terms for senators which many small-d democrats might find unpalatable.
