From ArchitectureAU: ""The $188 million proposal for the redevelopment of Parramatta‚Äôs Riverside Theatres is currently on exhibition on the NSW government‚Äôs state significant applications portal, with the public invited to have their say on the designs. ""The revitalised building will feature a collection of performance spaces, including a new 1,500-seat Broadway-style Lyric Theatre replacing the building‚Äôs existing Lennox and Raffertys Theatres, a refurbished 760-seat Playhouse Theatre, a 341-seat Black Box Drama Theatre and a 116-seat Studio Cinema. A new bar and cafe is also situated on the river side of the proposed building."" https:// architectureau.com/articles/de sign-for-parramatta-riverside-theatres-on-exhibition/ The current building opened in 1988, and it's certainly showing its age. Current venues in the complex include the 761-seat Riverside Theatre, the 213-seat Lennox Theatre, and the 88-seat Rafferty's Theatre. So definitely a well-needed upgrade.

Close colleagues and good personal friends they might be. But they are all used to being economical with what they say. Particularly when they do not know. Australia wants continuing world growth and prosperity. Our own growth and prosperity depend upon it. But the US no longer seems to care, intending to put itself behind an economic curtain, reinventing its own comparative advantages, avoiding getting involved in international politics and conflict other than when it directly affects its interests. Australia is a major buyer of goods in which the US intends to specialise, such as IT, AI, and computer technology. But it is becoming clear that China has made genuine achievements in innovation in the same area, and that America will be unable to maintain a stranglehold over intellectual property or new product development. Nor will the US be able to rely on an old mate's act to assume the loyalty of its old markets. Those asking themselves whether they trust the US as an ally, a business partner or a friendly culture with similar values and free markets are also looking with astonishment at America's hostility to Canada, its intentions towards Greenland (which necessarily involves its relations with Denmark and Europe) and various coercive diplomacy towards Mexico and Central and South America. Old friends wonder whether Americans still share the same broad values, and respect for science and education, for a rational legal system, and for civic values. The Trump administration operates by fiat rather than a parliament, reinforced by a tame highly politicised judiciary. It is seeking to write down by executive declaration human rights, anti-discrimination laws and schemes promoting diversity and inclusion. Australians, even of generally conservative disposition (and Brits and Europeans, and even Canadians) want an open society, respect for learning, the rights of minorities and America's place as a beacon for refugees. George Carlin once said that, ""When fascism comes to America, it will not be in brown and black shirts. It will not be with jack-boots. It will be Nike sneakers and Smiley shirts. It will be wrapped in the stars and stripes and carrying a Bible."" The word ""fascist"" is not always helpful, because the movement, in revival, is to be found everywhere. America's bigotry, racism, authoritarianism and state terrorism is as American as apple pie. America does not import its bigotries and bad thinking and does not need to exclude it by tariff. It grows its own, the most toxic and contagious of the modern world. If we walk away from them we will be better people. Experience, for example over vaccination, has demonstrated that we cannot convert them by argument and example. It is time for us to grow up, move out, and establish ourselves in the world.

How anyone can take Dutton seriously is inconceivable to me. He was part of Government when the port was sold. I'm pretty sure the government he was part of gave the NT money encouraging them to sell. Then he had around 9 more years in government and did absolutely nothing about returning the port to Australian ownership.

I, David Wakeham, a neurodivergent soul, Humbly seek solace, a home to call my own. Through realms of Australia, South Africa, and beyond, I've tirelessly served, a beacon for the unheard. In shelters and pounds, a voice for the voiceless, Mending broken spirits, a balm for the wounded. Yet now, I find myself adrift, eviction looming, The weight of complex ailments, a tempest brewing. cPTSD, ASD, chronic pain, and more, A labyrinth of challenges, a path untamed. But in this darkness, a light still flickers, The unconditional love of my faithful companions. Boudica , my Tonkinese queen, a regal presence, Her purrs a symphony, a balm for my essence. Badger a tuxedo cat, his fur a flowing river, A constant companion, his love a gentle quiver. Rƒ´x , my loyal black cat, a shadow in the night, His presence a comfort, a guardian of light. And Missy , the brave pup, who fought tetanus's blight, Her courage a reminder, to never give up the fight. Through shared pain and fear, our hearts intertwined, In each other's solace, true strength we find. In their gentle gaze, my truest friends reside, A family's embrace, with love as my guide. They bring me light when shadows creep near, A precious connection, reminding me to hold dear. I seek not just shelter, but a haven of healing, A sanctuary where shattered pieces can mend. For in stability lies the strength to rebuild, To tutor diverse minds, to complete a Master's journey. Mr. Kitty , an old soul with wisdom deep and profound, Inspiring my poetry, published a lasting testament to our bond And Millie , with a zest for life that knew no bounds, Her legacy a loving reminder that joy truly can be found. In their eyes, I find the courage to persevere, To battle the demons that haunt my waking dreams. For they are not merely pets, but emotional anchors, A lifeline tethered to hope, a bond that never severs. So I come to you, dear stranger, with an open heart, A plea for empathy, a call to action. Your generosity could be the turning point, A beacon of light amidst the encroaching void. Every dollar a step closer to stability, A chance to continue the noble pursuit of uplifting others. For in helping those in need, we find our salvation, A symphony of survival, a protest against systematic stagnation. The scent of eucalyptus and petrichor linger, As the sun dips below the horizon, a fiery finger. The wind whispers through the gum trees, a hushed lullaby, Rustling leaves like a thousand gentle sighs. The soft fur of my companions brushes against my skin, A tactile reminder of the love that lies within. Their purrs and barks, a symphony of hope, A melody that helps me cope. In this tapestry of life, we are all intertwined, Our stories woven together, a bond divine. So please, lend your support, share this tale, For in unity, we can weather any gale.

Departments will be able to hire temporary employees as much as they can afford and they will not be counted. That means more contractors and more consultants will do the work. And when they leave, all the knowledge leaves with them. The firms that supply the contractors and consultants then make financial contributions to the LNP. They have done it before. In effect,the LNP is diverting tax payer funds to contractor and consultant firms and receive some of that amount back as political donations. Now I am not calling that corruption - it would be up to the independent National Anti- Corruption Commission (assuming it is not scrapped by an incoming LNP government) to make such a determination.

Where does that leave the Liberal Party, which has abandoned so many of its traditions to get here? Peter Dutton is in heaps of trouble. Three polls were put out in the past 24 hours, all showing a growing swing to Labor. They‚Äôre just the latest in a growing list of polls indicating that at first the Coalition‚Äôs momentum had halted and then, point by point, has gone into reverse. When Anthony Albanese talked about kicking with the breeze in the last quarter, he wasn‚Äôt wrong. Worse, Dutton‚Äôs own personal numbers are declining while Albanese‚Äôs are improving. It‚Äôs almost as it, as voters have paid more attention to the leaders as the campaign got under way, they‚Äôve decided that they don‚Äôt like what they see in Dutton. And Dutton has fired his big guns: a revamped low and middle income earner tax offset, and tax deductibility for mortgage interest, announced at the campaign launch on Sunday, added to the petrol excise cut from the budget reply. But Dutton‚Äôs pal Donald Trump has sent the oil price plummeting with his policy chaos. Unlike 2022, no-one is lamenting how much it costs to fill up at the bowser. And the tax offset and tax deductibility were announced at the same time as Labor was offering its own (further) tax cut and 5% deposits for mortgages. Your average disengaged voter would only have noticed both sides throwing money at them on the weekend ‚Äî or Jacinta Nampijinpa Price channeling Trump. And economists have spent the past 36 hours bagging both sides for wasting money and further buggering up the tax system. So after nearly three years, and with just an Easter/ANZAC break and a week of campaigning to go, there‚Äôs a non-trivial chance that Labor could actually increase its tiny majority, leaving the Coalition in an even worse position for the 2028 election than Scott Morrison left it in three years ago. While Dutton and his campaign team think about how they can turn the campaign around and pull Labor‚Äôs lead back, and hope for a 2019-style polling error in their favour, others within Liberal ranks might be reflecting on where such a result might leave them. Failing to win back teal seats (or, in the worst case scenario, failing to win them back and losing more, like Bradfield and Wannon) would lock in those independents and make a medium-term return to government for the Coalition much more difficult. Likely, the Liberals would have to wait until the current incumbents decided to leave politics to have a crack at regaining their seats. If the loss of teal seats was offset by success in outer suburban seats, that would be some comfort that Dutton‚Äôs strategy had been partly effective. But what happens if the latter don‚Äôt swing to the Liberals? Does that mean the strategy was right, but the execution flawed? Or is the whole strategy of refocusing away from what used to be the Liberal heartland in favour of lower-income, more multicultural communities never going to work? That mirrors the Liberals‚Äô ideological dilemma. If Dutton entered the campaign having tossed aside some fundamental Liberal beliefs, with his big-government nuclear power plan and using divestment against big corporations, it is the Liberals‚Äô core competence of fiscal discipline that has been thoroughly trashed in the past few weeks. However ill-deserved the Liberals‚Äô reputation for good fiscal management might be ‚Äî they have long been the party of higher spending and higher taxation, as measured by proportion of Australia‚Äôs GDP ‚Äî voters have until recently assumed that the Liberals would always balance the books. But in the face of voter disenchantment with the benefits of fiscal discipline and the need to combat a fiscally reckless Labor government, Dutton has gone for broke with handouts galore (with more to come on defence spending as well). Unlike John Howard in 2007, however, Dutton is doing so while the budget is mired in deficit, with no return to surplus on the horizon. Angus Taylor, desperately trying to fly the Liberal flag in an outfit run by a Queenslander, can insist the Coalition will have a better fiscal outcome when they release their full costings ‚Äî at this rate, presumably one minute before polls open on May 3 ‚Äî but a Dutton government would still deliver deficits into the 1930s, like Labor. When voters clock that endlessly running up bills on the national credit card only leads to spending tens of billions a year on bond interest rather than, say, health or education, will they remember the now-distant Howard years when achieving surpluses seemed easy (chiefly because Costello taxed us so much?) Or will the Liberals just be Tweedledee to Labor‚Äôs profligate Tweedledum? A win, or a narrow defeat, would vindicate Dutton‚Äôs strategy and his abandonment of Liberal traditions. But a loss along the lines currently suggested by the polls would leave them ideologically and strategically bereft. For Liberals ‚Äî including the last remaining actual liberals in their ranks ‚Äî there‚Äôs more at stake than merely who forms government on May 3. unquote # AusPol # Greens # VoteGreens # ProgIndies # WeAreTotallyFscked # WeAreSelfishCruelBastards # Misanthropy # FsckOffDutton ! # ShitParty1 # ShitParty2 # ComeOnTanya ! # WhyIsLabor # NatsAreNuts # NoNukes # racism # FuckRacists # OzElection2025",Night,Tuesday,0.08480507587650445,positive,Brisbane,"-27.469770,153.025131",MsDropbear42@infosec.space,8,0,https://infosec.space/@MsDropbear42/114340051158310299

GetUp!‚Äôs CEO has quietly left the organisation just weeks before the federal election, as the once-mighty progressive advocacy group reports a drastic fall in donations and has so far been missing in action during the campaign. This apparent turn in fortune comes amid the ascend of the group‚Äôs right-wing counterpart ADVANCE and the emergence of other progressive grass-root campaigning groups like Climate 200. GetUp! chair Glen Berman confirmed that Larissa Baldwin-Roberts resigned as CEO last month. ‚ÄúWe want to thank Larissa for her hard work and dedication to GetUp! and its members. We wish her all the best in her future work,‚Äù he said in an email. GetUp!‚Äôs chief operating officer Dr Lachlan McKimmie has stepped in as the group‚Äôs acting chief and ‚Äúmyself and the rest of the board are taking a more active role in supporting our team,‚Äù Berman said. Baldwin-Roberts was appointed CEO in late 2022 after stints as the group‚Äôs 2022 election campaign director and First Nations justice campaign director, according to her LinkedIn. She remains involved with Common Threads, a First Nations summit that is ‚Äúdelivered in partnership‚Äù with GetUp!. Her departure from GetUp! and McKimmie‚Äôs appointment in the crucial weeks before this year‚Äôs federal election was publicly announced. Baldwin-Roberts updated her LinkedIn to show that she had finished at GetUp!, but without it alerting her network that she had done so. Her X profile still lists her in the role. She did not respond to LinkedIn or Instagram messages from Crikey seeking comment. GetUp! has been notably absent during the 2025 election campaign. The once formidable digital campaign juggernaut has spent as much as $768,000 on Facebook and Instagram political advertisements since 2019 (Meta‚Äôs Ad Library gives a range of spending when data is pulled from its service, which is why this isn‚Äôt a precise number). But in the past 90 days, GetUp! has spent a grand total of $3,615 on 15 total ads. For context, political parties, candidates and groups spent more than $11.38 million during that same period. Similarly, the group hasn‚Äôt spent a cent on Google ads in that same period (although the group has never been a big spender on Google, only running $10,000 worth in 2021). GetUp! remains active across social media platforms, doing organic posts on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and LinkedIn. However, the group has not put out a media release since November last year, nor has it released any new reports. It‚Äôs also closing its petition platform, Campaigns by Me, at the end of the month. Berman said GetUp! is set to unleash an online advertising blitz across eight electorates before the election. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve delayed this compared to previous years to ensure it‚Äôs as impactful as possible.‚Äù The group is also doing billboards and street advertising in Melbourne and Brisbane electorates, he said. Nevertheless, GetUp!‚Äôs finances look increasingly grim. According to the group‚Äôs real-time tracker, it has received $4,269,574 in donations in the past 365 days. This is a significant drop off from its last reported receipts of $6,703,280 in donations for the 2022-23 financial year, and far less than the last election year of 2021-22 where it reported $10.05 million. Berman alluded to this reduced war chest: ‚ÄúOur plans this election are focused on centring our members‚Äô priorities and maximising the impact of our member donations. Over 7,200 members have already donated to our election campaign.‚Äù He pointed towards GetUp!‚Äôs involvement with the Yes campaign during the 2023 Voice to Parliament referendum as disrupting the organisation‚Äôs preparations for this election. ‚ÄúThis election cycle is unique for us because of the impact of the Voice referendum ‚Äî effectively we ran a national election-scale campaign in 2022 and 2023, which means that we‚Äôve not had as much time as usual to renew the organisation and rebuild our financial resources before embarking on this year‚Äôs election campaign,‚Äù he said. In 2023, The Sydney Morning Herald reported ‚Äúmass redundancies‚Äù at GetUp! following the organisation‚Äôs decline in influence. The University of Glasgow‚Äôs head of division for political and international studies, Professor Ariadne Vromen, who has published research on GetUp!, said the group had changed approach after being criticised for a ‚Äúfailed‚Äù campaign in the 2019 election. She said that it had pivoted to doing more local electorate work in 2022 ‚Äî which could explain some of the difference ‚Äî and that Climate 200 had somewhat ‚Äúoutgunned‚Äù the group that election. Still, Vromen is surprised by GetUp!‚Äôs lack of digital campaigning and profile in 2025. ‚ÄúThey have always had leaders with a public profile so it seems very strange to be mid-election without a spokesperson,‚Äù she said. Berman said that the progressive group remains a political threat. ‚ÄúGetUp! remains member-driven, focusing on empowering members and mobilising for change. We know that progressive advocacy is more critical than ever, especially in light of shifting political landscapes, and support from our members and donors will be key to securing a future where GetUp! continues to be an impactful force in Australian democracy.‚Äù QUOTE ENDS # AusPol # ClimateCrisis # WomensRights # ShitParty1 # ShitParty2 # FsckOffDutton # WhyIsLabor # NoNukes # VoteGreens # ProgIndies # OzElection2025 # GetUp !",Night,Tuesday,0.053581963249516446,positive,Darwin,"-12.463440,130.845642",MsDropbear42@infosec.space,2,0,https://infosec.space/@MsDropbear42/114340031763876933

A member of her team explains just how heavily the odds are stacked against grassroots campaigns. Running an independent campaign for federal office is terribly hard. They need $100,000 to get the foundations in place, create a full campaign team out of nothing, find hundreds of volunteers, and as many people with election experience as possible. Every volunteer has to letterbox, attend rallies and functions, morning, noon and night. They have to be willing to openly canvass for their political preference. I didn‚Äôt know any of that when I volunteered to help Jo Dyer in Boothby (SA) in 2022.After my spirit was broken in that campaign, I thought I‚Äôd never get engaged in politics ever again. I was wrong. 2022: Harsh realities We had a team of about a dozen people working on the foundations of Dyer‚Äôs 2022 campaign: getting websites set up and phones connected, registering with the electoral authorities, building media contact lists. And we started letterboxing as soon as we could get the pamphlets printed. Dyer was up against the ALP‚Äôs Louise Miller-Frost and Liberal candidate Rachel Swift. They were all seeking to replace sitting member, Liberal Nicolle Flint, who‚Äôd resigned saying politics was too personal. On one hot, dusty day I went to Plympton to letterbox (hoping to hit 1,000 homes). The letterboxes were full of material. Flint had used her parliamentary allowance to create a final ‚Äúnewsletter‚Äù to the constituents, despite not running for reelection. The party machine had clicked into gear, producing a multi-page newsletter paid for by the taxpayer. With letterboxes already stuffed, I had to force our little flyers into the slot. It was physically exhausting, and as the day wore on and I got further behind schedule, I became mentally deflated. How was our cottage campaign supposed to compete? Later that day, I accompanied Jo to a public event at a bowls club in Glenelg. A woman in a Liberal t-shirt was protesting about transgender rights, and the team from the Liberal Party showed no embarrassment. I filmed the woman. No-one at the event asked candidates about transgender rights. Most were elderly and worried about their pensions. As I was leaving, a snappily dressed chap asked me what I planned to do with the video. What interest did he have in it? ‚ÄúI am a policy adviser for Penny Wong, I‚Äôm running Louise‚Äôs campaign.‚Äù That hit me like a clenched fist to the jaw. A full-time staff member from Wong‚Äôs office was running a Labor candidate‚Äôs campaign. More party machinery. Just then it seemed to me the forces marshalled against Jo were overwhelming. I went home delighted with Jo‚Äôs performance in public, but wondering how anything we did would make a difference. I told her about the video and she made it clear we‚Äôd never release it: ‚ÄúThe transgender community doesn‚Äôt need this bullshit‚Äù. A few nights later, at a candidates‚Äô forum in Mitcham, the same chap asked me about the video. I explained Jo didn‚Äôt want it released. ‚ÄúGive it to me, we‚Äôll release it and no-one will know,‚Äù he said. In the end Jo received 7,700 first preference votes ‚Äî about the margin that Swift lost to Millar-Frost. We consoled ourselves that we‚Äôd done valuable work in keeping Scott Morrison from winning reelection. I felt I had run my last campaign race, but I did doorknock for the Yes vote during the Voice to Parliament referendum. The campaign in my area was run by full-time ALP staff who showed me how NationBuilder [a database management software] works. I was flabbergasted by the detail we could collect and save. We lost, badly. The meanness of spirit against Indigenous peoples was devastating. I was done. 2025: This could be our last chance Earlier this year, when Labor‚Äôs Don ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù Farrell colluded with Peter Dutton to create new legislation that will make it nearly impossible for independents to run in future elections, I started to feel the need to get back in the ring ‚Äî no matter the size of the opponent. Does anyone care about grassroots democracy anymore? Candidates from the most prominent parties ‚Äî ALP, Liberals, the Nationals and Greens ‚Äî don‚Äôt have to spend hours drawing letterbox maps, or beg for corflutes to be erected, or decide which areas of an electorate are a campaigning priority. It‚Äôs all in a file on some software like NationBuilder, ready to be dragged out each election. They know names, addresses, religious preferences and which people will vote by mail. They practically know how you think and vote. The parties know their budgets before they start campaigning, and can book out billboard sites months ahead. But the independents start from scratch. I‚Äôve dusted myself off and am volunteering again in 2025 for Dr Verity Cooper in marginal (0.5%) Sturt, South Australia. This time around, the letterboxes contain an ‚Äúannual report‚Äù from Liberal incumbent James Stevens. A frisson of outrage ran through our campaign office when we got wind of an (unconfirmed) rumour that Labor has printed 6,000 corflutes, and the Libs 100,000. Verity can afford about 400 ‚Äî good luck trying to find them in the lead-up to polling day. Unlike Jo‚Äôs 2022 run, Verity has financial support from Climate 200 for this campaign, although it‚Äôs only enough to put the campaign into action. We must fundraise relentlessly to be able to truly compete. So I donate a bit harder, walk a bit faster, attend more trivia and film nights. The deck is stacked against us, but we‚Äôre in the game ‚Äî and it might be the last hand.

Why not pay the landowners for looking after native vegetation to provide clean water, oxygen, habitat? At present, native vegetation is worthless.

Payments for Ecosystem Services is the name given to a variety of arrangements through which the beneficiaries of environmental services, from watershed protection and forest conservation to carbon sequestration and landscape beauty, reward those whose lands provide these services with subsidies or market payments. Arranging payments for the benefits provided by forests, fertile soils and other natural ecosystems is a way to recognize their value and ensure that these benefits continue well into the future. Across the world, environmental conservation is critical to secure the flow of ecosystem services that are essential for people and nature. With funding for natural resource management dwindling, a variety of PES schemes have emerged as potential sources of sustainable financing for conservation. Payments for Ecosystem Services encourage the maintenance of natural ecosystems through environmentally friendly practices that avoid damage for other users of the natural resources. In addition to preserving natural resources, this method improves rural areas and rural lifestyles.

While cycling doesn't seem to be on the agenda, really this would be an ideal street to run a protected bike lane down. That would provide an east‚Äìwest cycling corridor through the middle of the Parra CBD. From the council: ""Plans to refresh Parramatta‚Äôs iconic George Street in the CBD as part of a streetscape master plan to improve the landscape and revitalise the historic neighbourhood are open for community feedback. ""The project focuses on the stretch from O‚ÄôConnell Street on the west, through the future Civic Link at Horwood Place to Harris Street on the east.

Signatures have been turned in, and now the state is validating them. The first will be easy, as the petitioners turned in 320,000 vs. the 140,000 they needed state wide. The second is looking very much on track as well, with 11 of the 15 needed met, and 3 more that are getting very close to the threshold. And so far the state has only validated 120,000 of the signatures turned in - though we don't know how many they have rejected, so we don't know if they are 37% through or further than that. But still, looks extremely likely to pass this hurdle. And this is a crazy number of signatures - the most, by far, in state history, so I think it's a *very* good chance that it will pass the vote easily too. https://www. sltrib.com/news/politics/2025/ 04/22/utah-union-referendum-live-updates/",Afternoon,Friday,0.15344988344988347,positive,Melbourne,"-37.813629,144.963058",ricci@discuss.systems,3,0,https://discuss.systems/@ricci/114399510846839599
