That might be a reasonable concern for a single small apartment building but gets ridiculous if you've got more apartment buildings without car parking. On-street parking is very low capacity so once you've got more than 30 apartments on a street it's no longer even physically possible for people in the apartments to get cars and park on the street. But if you do build car parking in apartment buildings then you've got to deal with traffic and traffic that gets worse with every additional apartment building. Building apartment buildings with no car parking is the only way to address the housing crisis. # vicpol # auspol # HousingCrisisAustralia,Evening,Wednesday,0.011172161172161176,positive,Melbourne,"-37.813629,144.963058",jessta@aus.social,5,1,https://aus.social/@jessta/114112268230498142

By Jake Horton and Shayan Sardarizadeh Trump said millions of people aged 100 & above, and in some cases even over 200 or 300, are still on the Social Security database & receiving payments. “Money is being paid to many of them and we’re searching right now,” Trump said. Social Security provides a base income for people in the US who are either retired or can't work because of a disability. It covers about 67 million Americans. BBC Verify has been unable to find specific evidence for Trump’s claim - although we don't have access to all the Social Security data. Lee Dudek, acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration, said in a statement last month, external that people aged 100 or above without a date of death on their record “are not necessarily receiving benefits”. The Social Security Administration in 2021 estimated some 24,000 people received payments from the agency after death, amounting to almost $300m. There is a 2023 report by the Social Security inspector general which identified about 19 million people born in 1920 or earlier who didn't have any death data on file - 44,000 of whom were still receiving social security benefits. There were an estimated 101,000 people over 100 years old in 2024 across the US, according to the Pew Research Center, external - most of whom you would expect to be receiving Social Security. # USPol # auspol # Lies # FakeFacts # Dementia https://www. bbc.com/news/live/cdxqvxwnyr5t ?post=asset%3Ae07b3dd6-a72f-4253-8240-8131eac57b36#post",Night,Wednesday,-0.0008365508365508363,negative,Hobart,"-42.882137,147.327195",Alpha1Nine@aus.social,2,0,https://aus.social/@Alpha1Nine/114107843938229798

Feel free to share if you think this is useful (and suggest improvements) Care for trans children is about giving them agency to decide who they want to be. For young kids this is social transition; clothes, hair, names, sparkly tiaras. There is usually some degree of counselling and socialisation through all this, as appropriate for the child Once they reach puberty, puberty blockers are used to delay changes and give the person time. Puberty blockers buy time by preventing permanent changes from puberty. Internal puberty will resume if they stop blockers (they were developed to treat early puberty in cisgender kids) Eventually they will probably start Hormone Replacement Therapy, but the point is to give them a choice on what puberty to go through. HRT is broadly safe Surgery is only done if the person wants it, and generally after 16 or 18 depending on the type. There are a lot of different options here All of these processes were developed to treat various medical issues in cisgender and/or intersex kids. What's happening here is that it just centers the child's choices, rather than impose society's values on them The whole process is driven by what the person wants. It's about children's agency and bodily autonomy You can't force transgender kids to be cisgender. That just results in traumatised or dead trans people. This is all about supporting children to be happy Some common BS talking points: Desistance / detransition - generally children who come out as trans continue to be trans. The claims otherwise are based on a terrible study had too low a threshold for inclusion and falsely classified people as cis The point is to give children agency, so if they do decide they're cis then that's fine. The treatment has worked Rapid onset gender dysphoria - this is just bullshit. What's happening is that parents are assuming dysphoria started around when the person came out to them, when what actually happened is the person doesn't trust their parents enough to be open about this. The trans person doesn't trust their parents because their parents are bigots Social contagion - people are just more aware that you can be trans, and that includes being non-binary. People have more knowledge and control over their lives, seems good to me ""There are only two sex/genders"" - this is just a bullshit assertion, equivalent to ""the earth is flat"" or ""we didn't come from monkeys"".

The end goal of rich people and politicians is to keep people miserable enough to keep them busy but not so miserable to not have anything to lose. And as the result, society finds an easier target, a less protected and the most unfortunate part of itself to blame and destroy. People will start stealing from one another to survive, and that's when compassion, empathy, and sympathy die. When a group of people rises against the oppressors, the rest of the society would stand and watch. And when they themselves rise, there's no one else left to rise with them. By not rising against the oppressor all together, people will pass on the burden to their children and their children's children until a generation comes that have nothing to lose and nothing to fight for, so they become numb. I'm an Iranian who lives in Australia. The above is what I witnessed in my country. And unfortunately, I can also see the seeds of what happened in my country being planted in Western civilization. The US and the UK are already advancing in this path. The AU and NZ are starting the process. And I can see it happening in other countries around the globe. Will people of these countries recognize the threat and rise against it? Will society stand up for itself or sacrifice part of itself?

In the lead up, we have welcomed some important investments in essential services, including health, public education and early childhood education. “We’re astounded that the centrepiece of tonight’s budget is more dollars for everyone except those with the least. “Only a year after the last tax cuts, the government is announcing a new set. “We need a budget and an election that sets us up for the future. The last thing we need is a bidding war on more tax cuts. “In the face of a serious cost-of-living crisis and overwhelming evidence to fix JobSeeker, to give $7b in tax cuts and do nothing to lift people out of poverty is simply shocking. “This budget has welcome investments in health, public education and care services, which help to restore years of cuts. Expanding bulk billing and boosting spending on public education will help communities around the country. The women’s health budget measures are good to see and address some of the gaps in our healthcare system. The guarantee of three days’ early learning is most welcome, especially for families on very low incomes. “The question for the next government is: how do you keep paying for these critical services upon which we all rely? “We don’t have a spending problem. We have a revenue problem. Governments can’t continue to waste over $30 billion a year on super and capital gains tax breaks for people in the top 10% of incomes. “We need to close these gaps in the tax and revenue base to meet the community’s needs ongoing. “We also need to ensure help goes to people who need it most. The government’s total $6.8b spend on energy bill rebates could have funded energy upgrades for every social housing property in Australia, permanently reducing bills by thousands of dollars each year. “As Australia heads toward an election, ACOSS calls on all parties and candidates who wish to form government to embrace an ambitious vision that leaves no one behind. “People in Australia are yearning for more substantial reform. They’ve weathered difficult times and deserve a government willing to make bold investments in our shared future.” # auspol2025 # budget2025",Morning,Tuesday,0.1561714708056171,positive,Gold Coast,"-28.016667,153.400000",earthmothering9@aus.social,5,0,https://aus.social/@earthmothering9/114222408384185179
