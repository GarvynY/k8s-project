Its agenda, designed to serve its business interests and not the national interest, is deeply damaging to the Liberals. Reading the chin-stroking commentary from News Corp over the last 48 hours on what caused such a catastrophic defeat for their political allies is a lot like watching the burglar who, having broken in and trashed a house, complains loudly about what a mess the inhabitants live in. News Corp, and the editors it employs to run its political campaigns, owns a very great deal of this disaster. And the sooner it accepts that ‚Äî of course, it won‚Äôt ‚Äî the sooner its friends in the Liberal Party can get back to being politically relevant. What the Liberal Party itself needs to understand is that News Corp is a foreign-owned communications business, with its own agenda of fostering hatred, resentment and division in order to sell advertising and subscriptions. Its alliance with the Liberals is in pursuit of those goals ‚Äî not in pursuit of good policy. Its best interests are those of the Murdochs and other shareholders that are paramount to News Corp‚Äôs business model (which, let us remember, pays not a single cent of tax in Australia), not those of Australians. That‚Äôs why News Corp will always encourage the Liberals to pursue policies that punch downward, that divide and alienate, that are about culture wars targeting minorities. We can complain about the toxic effects of fostering division and resentment, but in the words of that eminent statesman, Michael Corleone, it‚Äôs not personal, Sonny, it‚Äôs strictly business. That means that any Liberal who wants to be in the business of unifying Australians (News Corp is always bleating about policies that are ‚Äúdivisive‚Äù but strangely silent on the benefits of bringing Australians together) will automatically face pushback from News Corp. And any failure to aggressively pursue culture wars will be regarded as evidence of weakness ‚Äî not because culture wars work politically, but because they fire up Sky News‚Äô, The Australian‚Äôs and the News Corp tabloids‚Äô angry, old, white audiences. But that‚Äôs only the start of the way News Corp undermines the Liberals‚Äô capacity to engage meaningfully with the electorate. The company and its pundits have a wildly inflated self-belief in their understanding of ordinary Australians. Its editors, journalists and commentators are even whiter and older than those of other media outlets (myself included). They are every bit the chattering class elitists they rail at, living in wealthy suburbs and enjoying above-average incomes or, in the case of executives, wildly inflated salaries. They have no understanding of the lot of ordinary working Australians, especially in the outer suburbs of our cities, which are good only for car crash and crime stories, and especially not Australians from migrant or non-English-speaking backgrounds. Result: the policies, priorities and tactics they believe the Liberals should pursue only reflect the interests of those of their affluent background, not of people living in the real world. They‚Äôre people who actually think sitting through a Welcome to Country is an outrageous infringement of their rights that should be centre-stage in an election campaign, rather than the cost of living or economic precarity. As a foreign-controlled company, News Corp is also a vector for foreign political ideas. In particular, it is a conduit for ideas from the United States‚Äô deeply toxic and polarised political environment, including conspiracy theories and culture war obsessions. The story of the now decades-long climate denialism of the Liberal Party is only explicable in terms of News Corp‚Äôs relentless denialism and importation of the tactics of fossil fuel companies. The war on ‚Äúwoke‚Äù is a Made In USA fabrication imported here by News Corp. So too the ongoing assault on trans people. Conspiracy theories about election tampering ‚Äî still being peddled by the Coalition on the weekend ‚Äî and elite cabals plotting to destroy the country are all funnelled into Australia via News Corp. And as more than just Crikey are now pointing out, News Corp ensures that Liberal leaders and frontbenchers are permanently enfeebled when it comes to selling policies. News Corp creates a bubble in which every Liberal policy is brilliant, every announcement or tactic is a masterstroke, in which no Liberal leader can ever put a foot wrong. Only after an election defeat does the mask temporarily come off, and its pundits and journalists reveal what a shambolic, incompetent show they were advertising all along. That bubble lends a false sense of confidence to Liberals: not only are they in touch with real Australians rather than just another elite vested interest, but their arguments are strong, and will hold up to scrutiny ‚Äî something that News Corp reserves, by and large, for Labor and the teals. For hard evidence, look at the striking failure of News Corp‚Äôs campaign to demonise Labor as antisemitic. Since October 2023, News Corp has been portraying the Albanese government as, at best, lackadaisical about the growing threat of antisemitism and, at worst, an active enabler of it. Peter Dutton gleefully ran exactly the same line. Both Dutton and News Corp tried to peddle conspiracy theories about the Dural non-bomb. Both portrayed the government as doing nothing about violence against Jewish schools and residences. How did that work out? Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus enjoyed a 5%+ swing in Isaacs. Josh Burns got a 3% swing in Macnamara, where the Greens and Liberals both went backwards. In contrast, Liberal Julian Leeser in Sydney‚Äôs Berowra suffered a nearly 6% swing against him, and his seat is now very marginal. After the campaign of lies and conspiracy theories from News Corp and the Liberals about Labor‚Äôs purported antisemitism, and how only Dutton would protect Australian Jews, it‚Äôs a staggering result. If News Corp wants the Liberals to keep losing, the answer is simple: keep on doing what you‚Äôre doing. Keep on pushing the Liberals toward culture wars and elite obsessions that are only aimed at stoking division. Keep on attacking any Liberals who dare to pursue centrist or evidence-based policies. Keep on telling the Liberals they know what working Australians really want. Keep on spreading far-right conspiracy theories. And keep on making sure the Liberals enter election contests woefully unprepared for the most basic scrutiny.

This election shows the public don‚Äôt like it, and the result has done untold damage to media relevance. There are plenty of losers from Saturday‚Äôs election. But the biggest ‚Äî and most consequential? The news media. Looks like that commercialisation of snark they were so eager to lean into as a business model has been irretrievably shattered. It wasn‚Äôt just Saturday‚Äôs vote that did it. The election result showed up the snark for the paper tiger it was. Electorate by electorate, the politicians most applauded by the media for their savvy shrillness ‚Äî left, right and centre ‚Äî were quietly pushed back (and, usually, out) when voters got the chance. The sneering, punch-down outrage manufactured wholesale by News Corp (and subsequently absorbed into ‚Äúnews values‚Äù across media) fell victim to the unexpected triumph of a public yearning for a bit of positivity, kindness and gentility. Don‚Äôt (just) blame the Coalition of the shrilling who saw their votes drop ‚Äî look to the Greens‚Äô Max Chandler-Mather from the left, Jacqui Lambie from the centre or (take your pick) just about any Liberal Party frontbencher on the right. They‚Äôve spent the past three years servicing the rent-a-quote market ‚Äî a Pavlovian feedback loop created by our broken media‚Äôs rewards of prime-time attention and Facebook algorithmic virality. Night after night on the evening news (yes, even on the ABC), the political story of the day has been delivered wrapped in an outrage grab ‚Äî about process, policy, personality ‚Äî with the prize of getting your face on screen going to whoever shouted loudest. In light of the election result, rising politicians need to recognise the old rule has flipped: now, not all publicity is good publicity. And, the media? It needs to stop trying to hang onto the dwindling traffic it has and think more about the two-thirds of Australians who actively avoid the news that old media has opted to give them. Avoiding the stories legacy media treats as ‚Äúnews‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean people get no political news at all. While the legacy media sagely waved past the Liberals preferencing of One Nation as just part of the numbers game, it lit up social media platforms like Xiaohongshu and WeChat, leading to the resultant swings in seats with large numbers of Chinese-Australian voters. In a first-draft-of-history kind of way, this remains the most far-reaching moment of the campaign. It will be talked about long after the trivia of kicked footballs and stage stumbles is forgotten. There‚Äôs plenty of blame for the media mess to go around. It starts (of course) with News Corp‚Äôs embrace of activist media and its subsequent capture by the darkest corners of its own comments section, who, through their pay-walled subscriptions, pay to keep the lights on at Sky after dark and The Australian‚Äôs pundit desk. So politically toxic has the Murdoch brand become that it probably costs the Liberals more votes than it draws. Worse (for the Liberals, that is), its role as commissar for ideological thought prevents conservative parties from recognising what‚Äôs right in front of their eyes ‚Äî that they are their own problem. Across the mastheads (particularly in The Australian) and on Sky, the News Corp punditocracy spent the parliamentary term painting straw man Albanese as simply too weak and too woke. The result? The conservatives got high on their own supply, convinced ‚Äî as they kept telling each other ‚Äî that Albanese was simply not reelectable. The ideological disciplining of the right‚Äôs thought leaders ‚Äî particularly on Sky ‚Äî led Dutton into his culture war stumbles like ‚Äúhate media‚Äù and the Welcome to Country imbroglio. Trump-like, they struggle now to accept the legitimacy of Labor‚Äôs win in the face of the ‚Äúlies‚Äù narrative they worked so hard to cement. At the beginning of the campaign, I wrote here in Crikey that News Corp simply doesn‚Äôt matter. Still true ‚Äî but that‚Äôs just with voters. The real danger of News Corp has been its cultural impact on the way Australian media goes about its business. Partly, it‚Äôs the way Murdoch media shapes how the rest of the news media sees people and policies. Their relentless tearing down of Albanese might not have convinced many ‚Äúquiet Australians‚Ñ¢‚Äù, but it led astray even the best of Australia‚Äôs political commentators, including the normally far more astute Niki Savva or Crikey‚Äôs own Bernard Keane (as he, just about alone of Albanese‚Äôs critics, acknowledged over the weekend). But more, it‚Äôs the near-universal acceptance across legacy media of the Murdoch schtick that anger, rage and conflict are the definitive news values. If it works for News Corp, the rest of the media have convinced itself to think, maybe it will work for us, and perhaps it will for that dwindling minority of hardcore political junkie news consumers. Instead, the weekend vote showed that‚Äôs not where most Australians are. And looking at the best of journalism, it‚Äôs not where most journalists are, either. Once the election was called, the ABC reached for its strengths, mobilising its deep pool of journalists with a remarkable reporting pivot. The broadcaster dropped its dreary focus on the trivia of the politics of politics for a more detailed focus on policy and policy differences that engaged a diverse community and outside experts. Laura Tingle‚Äôs explainer on migration policy in the final week, for example, did much to illuminate the complexities of the issue in a way that broke through the frozen, post-Tampa talking points that have derailed reporting for over two decades. The ABC‚Äôs interviewers dialled back their irritating accountability-by-interrupting style (most of the time anyway). They were (again, usually) cautious about indulging the far right with a false ‚Äúall sides‚Äù bias. They kept alive policies (like Indigenous rights) that none of the major parties wanted to talk about. Sure, there‚Äôs much to criticise: the never-ending fetish for the largely economically irrelevant federal budget deficit, a leaning into finance industry economists as ‚Äúindependent‚Äù experts, and an insistence on the ‚Äúrise of the minors‚Äù narrative, long after the campaigning showed it was a story for last time, not this time. It lets us dare to hope: maybe, this parliamentary term, all our news media will catch up with Australian voters in repudiating the outrage gimmickry that has done so much damage to media relevance.

And normally, I'd be all for developments of this kind. Except for one small issue. It's in a floodplain. ""Parramatta CBD is set to have a ‚Äúground breaking‚Äù 45-level twin tower featuring modern apartments, three levels of retail and eateries within a uniquely designed building. ""Construction of ‚ÄòCosmopolitan,‚Äô the latest project by Sydney development company Deicorp, has begun and is said to be unlike anything currently within the suburb. ""Located at 34 Hassall St, the twin buildings will deliver 604 new apartments into the community by 2027."" https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/real-estate/development/ground-breaking-development-coming-to-western-sydney/news-story/e81864dd4853a95df521b032e1f749a4 The Tele's article fails to mention the drawn-out approvals process for a neighbouring apartment tower at 39 to 43 Hassall St. It was knocked back by Parramatta City Council (possibly the most pro-development council in Australia). The Council shared concerns with the State Emergency Services and a State Government agency about flood risk. (That decision was overturned by the NSW Planning Department.) That's because it's right next to a creek bed. ""[The NSW Planning Department] noted the Environment and Heritage Group, and the NSW State Emergency Service, opposed the development on flooding grounds. The site, which is adjacent to Clay Cliff Creek and close to the Parramatta River, is considered ‚Äúflood affected‚Äù. ‚Äú[The Environment and Heritage Group] raised concern that the proposal has potential to seriously increase flood risk to life and is not compatible with the flood risk of the land,‚Äù the department said. ""The developer tweaked an earlier proposal, reconfiguring the block and increasing the number of car spaces, in response to negative feedback in public submissions. But the City of Parramatta maintained its opposition on grounds the project did not meet the council‚Äôs design excellence standards, particularly as there was no clear setback between the tower and the podium level."" https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/sydney-council-rejects-build-to-rent-tower-plan-over-flood-risk-20240108-p5evsm.html ""Water engineering and hydrology firm GRC Hydro ‚Ä¶ noted the proposal included flood gates and doors to provide safe evacuation or a place to shelter during a flood emergency, and to protect the basement car park from inundation."" ""The [NSW Planning Department] said the flooding concerns could be mitigated with conditions. Those included a requirement a construction certificate not be issued until the certifier had evidence the building was ‚Äúsuitably designed to ensure the building does not fail due to floodwater forces, debris and buoyancy effects from flooding in events up to the [probable maximum flood] level as certified by a registered structural engineer.‚Äù"" ""Structural failure"" in this context is an engineering term that means ""the building collapses"". And why this all matters is because the Parramatta River can be a little floodprone: ""A senior SES official has warned that Parramatta's CBD could be overwhelmed by a flash flood in as little as nine minutes, giving residents little time to evacuate. ""George Jeoffreys, senior manager for risk reduction and avoidance at the NSW State Emergency Service, cited the difficulty of predicting flash floods. ‚Ä¶ ""Parramatta is a low-lying catchment area fed by 39 tributary creeks, any of which can cause flooding. But another expert said the risks seemed to have been ignored as the government and council continued with strategies to turn Parramatta into Sydney's second city centre. ""SES senior planning coordinator Marcus Morgan said the agency should have been involved earlier in the planning process."" https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/nine-minutes-to-flee-parramatta-s-catastrophic-flash-flooding-warning-20190214-p50xtv.html Now, I want to stress again that I'm usually all for higher-density housing and mixed-use developments close to public transport. Parramatta is the second biggest CBD in NSW, and there's a strong demand for new housing as office towers go up. And there are plenty of sites around Parramatta, especially in Parramatta North, which are close to the new light rail and would be ideal for more density. At the same time, because of global warming from fossil fuel pollution, floods are going to become more frequent and severe. I don't think putting tall apartment blocks next to creek beds in flood plains near the Parramatta ferry wharf is a great idea, from the point of view of climate resiliency. And at the very least, reporters writing about new developments built on floodplains should at least mention the fact. # Climate # ClimateChange # GlobalWarming # Parramatta # Urbanism # UrbanPlanning # NSW # NSWPol # Auspol # Australia",Night,Monday,0.06440346966466369,positive,Sydney,"-33.868820,151.209296",aj@gts.sadauskas.id.au,4,0,https://gts.sadauskas.id.au/@aj/statuses/01JTFDKGRYPJSY8P3DHC1XXWKR
