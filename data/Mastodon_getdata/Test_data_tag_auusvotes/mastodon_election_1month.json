Abusers are excellent at controlling the public narrative. Many abusers have close friends who believe they are kind to their families. We have absolutely no idea who in the public eye is abusive in the background and who is \"so nice at home\". Secondly: it doesn't matter how nice his is to three specific people if he's made it clear he's going to screw over hundreds of thousands of other people. Finally: it's wild that any form of emotion is read by the media as nice guy vibes. Toxic men are not immune from emotion. Emotion in men is not a sign of anything special or positive, no more than having legs or urinating.#ausvotes #auspol",

        "content": "I wake up to a mass of commentary on why Labor won with such a landside, and what went wrong for the Liberals. I've already seen dozens of local and federal issues which have been attributed to the results. Personally, I think most people sit somewhere near the centre of the political spectrum. They might be more fiscal or social justice in their priorities, but they are not keen on extremes. Labor ran a very safe campaign highlighting health, education and energy, while the Coalition went mad on nuclear energy, immigration and association with a Trumpian agenda.This final issue, modelling a centrist party on the US MAGA blueprint has obviously been a disaster for the Libs. I don't see them recovering quickly from this, though we have a State election here in Tasmania at the end of the month where an incumbent Liberal party will try to retain power which could be an early litmus test. I'm glad to see the demise of a very right wing Liberal party though I hoped for a hung parliament. The biggest issue for Labor will be complacency as the next election in 3 years will be theirs to lose rather than anyone else's to win. My hope is that Labor are not complacent but follow through progressive action on health, education, inequality, housing, climate etc. It's a slim hope, but I'll cling to it this morning after. #auspol #ausvotes",

        "content": "One of the obvious problems with policies that target reducing house prices to make buying a house easier is that once people have brought a house they move to having an incentive for house prices to rise. Nobody wants to be paying interest on an asset for 30yrs that is worth less than what you paid for it.This is why any policy that targets housing affordability needs to target renting and long term renting.Australia doesn't consider renting long term to be something that people want to do, everyone is expected to want to be a housing investor as soon as they can afford the deposit. (why wouldn't they when housing is such a good investment atm?)You shouldn't need to own a house to have a long term, stable, comfortable home. Most people don't need a housing asset to pass down to their children, they just need a stable place to live and retire in.The private rental market can't provide long term stability without a lot of regulation so we need that regulation.If I've got a stable long term lease then I'd be happy to pay to install a dishwasher or air conditioning for my own use. I'd pay to paint the house a colour I like and I'd pay for newI grew up in co-operative housing provided by CEHL (https://cehl.com.au/), they charged a rent of 25% of your income capped at a maximum 'cost rent' (In today's money it would be $460/w for a 4 bedroom house with a big backyard in Collingwood, after my parent's moved out we crammed 7 students in to that house). I lived in that rental house for 25yrs.The properties were managed by a group of the tenants who made sure rents were collected and organised maintenance.25% of the rent you paid was put toward maintenance of the properties, in the 90s when everyone was young we did a lot of our own maintenance together to save maintenance money.Working-bee days to paint a house, sand wooden floorboards or build a nice backyard garden.We can make long term stable renting a thing and we can build community around it.#Auspol #AusVotes https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-02/housing-affordability-policies-to-shift-votes-on-may-3-election/105235266",

I figured it would be easier than tomorrow, and with mum needing more 'hand-holding' it made sense to me.Firstly, incredibly well run, and very smooth. 3 Divisions being managed at my prepoll place, and never had any danger of going to the wrong place. Well signed, and supported by people.(They even had #democracySausage!)Secondly, I didn't realise quite how downhill Mum had gone. She went with Dad to get her ballots but then Dad left her on her own. I followed her and went into the booth next to her but kept an eye on her. She was so confused. Took me 20 seconds to fill out, and then went to help her. She has voted in Aust for 50 years, so she knows how it all works, but being an immigrant and having Alzheimers, I think she was remembering the 'last time' she voted - and tried to just tick the box of the candidate she wanted. God knows what she was going to do on the senate paper! Thankfully, I spoke to them both extensively about who they wanted to vote for and why, so I could help her by getting the right 'how to vote' card and telling her - put 1 here, 2 there etc. I know it was how she wanted to vote (and similar but not exactly like mine), but can't get over the fact that I basically influenced her vote, but reading the info from AEC I have reassured myself that I did everything exactly right.#ausVotes #AUSElection #WhatHashTagAreWeUsingThisTime",

        "content": "@pewnack @ajsadauskas My comment was more a reference to sections of the Australian media that want to regurgitate the \"cost of eggs\" narrative from the US election.Let me give a couple of examples.Here's 2GB's Mark Levy interviewing Peter Dutton earlier this year: \"Yeah, exactly. I get messages here on this programme, Mr Dutton, from listeners who say, ‚Äòwell, all we keep hearing is the Treasurer saying that, ‚Äòoh well, we‚Äôve brought inflation under control. Look at what we‚Äôve done to the economy‚Äù. And the point they make to me is: ‚Äòhave they walked into the local grocery store and done the weekly shop because everybody‚Äôs prices of everything is going up‚Äô ‚Äì petrol, groceries, eggs. I mean, it‚Äôs all there and there for everybody to see.\"Source: https://peterdutton.com.au/leader-of-the-opposition-transcript-interview-with-mark-levy-2gb-2/Murdoch's Sky News has trotted out a handpicked supposed ordinary voter from Western Sydney who is supposedly concerned about the price of eggs.Source: https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/politics/thinking-of-starting-to-raise-our-own-chickens-voter-pushed-to-extreme-measures-as-costs-of-fresh-produce-becomes-unbearable/news-story/3ac548f84106d939fae065b3d0beaf68As usual, our ABC is jumping on the News Corp bandwagon: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-26/why-are-eggs-so-expensive-in-australia-us-donald-trump/105091068I'm sure you can find more examples.So the narrative News Corp and others in the Australian political media are so confidently pushing is that the politicians (especially Labor) are out of touch with ordinary voters in Western Sydney.And the big issue supposedly on every voter's mind in Western Sydney is the price of eggs.That the people of Parramatta and surrounds are deeply upset by the price they're paying for their eggs.And the Murdoch press are so deeply in touch with the local zeitgeist they know this is the big issue.Well, as an actual voter living in actual Western Sydney, I find it somewhat amusing.Because *WHAT BLOODY EGGS*?!No-one is worried they're paying too much for eggs, when there's often none in store to buy!And here's the funny thing.Had any of these Dutton stenographers so much as stepped foot inside a Coles or Woolies in Western Sydney these past few months, there's an above-average chance they would have said: \"Huh. There's no eggs here.\"Because *WHAT BLOODY EGGS*?!#auspol #election25 #election2025 #ausvotes #nswpol #nsw",
