    "content": "Australia voted last week for a Labor majority — and when we say “Australia voted,” we mean that. Before the election, @ taniel of @ bolts talked to politics professor Judith Brett about the country’s compulsory voting law — its history, how it’s evolved, and whether it leads to better engagement as well as turnout. “Look, the fines that one pays are pretty minimal; you get a letter, and you’ve got to give a reason why you didn’t vote,” says Brett. “I don’t think the fine is the reason people vote. I think they vote because everybody votes. It’s the political culture around voting … What we know from research is, if you don’t have compulsory voting, the people least likely to vote are poorer people, and people from new migrant groups, and often the young. I think it means that there’s more of an egalitarian pressure on our politicians, and I think we end up with more egalitarian policies.” https:// boltsmag.org/compulsory-voting -australia-election/ # Newstodon # NewstodonFriday # FollowFriday # Australia # AustraliaElection # Voting # Elections # Law",

She said: One of the biggest threats to social cohesion and the country is the prime minister’s approach to Jewish Australians. Everything that happens overseas, and I have reflected on that, has domestic implications. We have a foreign minister, Penny Wong, who let down Australia in the UN this year and we have a prime minister who is intent on letting down Jewish Australians on the streets of our cities. One thing I have heard consistently over the last two years has been the sense of isolation, fear and real concern for our wonderful Jewish Australians. I want to make clear, going forward, we will work very hard to hold this prime minister and government to account because it is not acceptable to see what we have seen on the streets of our cities and in the universities.",

All across this land, the vibrant history of Australia's First Nations peoples tells the story of an ancient culture that continues today. Whether it is firestick farming used to sustainably manage Country, or the engineering of great stone fish traps across rivers and seas. Whether it was the practices of cultivating crops over tens of thousands of years, or the discovery and use of potent natural medicines. That unbroken line of innovation has continued to this day, despite what was wrought by the fiction of terra nullius. The traditional knowledge of Australia's First Peoples transformed this land. Made it liveable, made it home. That knowledge deserves international recognition. This treaty does just that.' # IndigenousIP # WIPO # geneticresources # biodiversity # auslaw # auspol",

    "content": "https://www. crikey.com.au/2025/05/12/coali tion-peter-dutton-nuclear-power-renewable-energy/ QUOTE BEGINS The priority for whoever emerges from the Liberal partyroom meeting as winner tomorrow should be to start what will likely be a colossal brawl over energy policy and climate, both within Liberal ranks and with the Nationals, who remain stubbornly climate denialist even without high-vis cosplayer Matt Canavan tilting for the leadership on a “no net zero” platform. The recovery of urban and suburban seats necessary for the Liberals to become competitive again will require fixing a number of problems: finding ways to stop alienating women and young voters, stopping the apparent involuntary questioning of the loyalty of Chinese-Australians — the last acceptable bigotry in Liberal ranks — and appearing relevant to an Australia where half the population is either from overseas or has a parent born overseas (and would thus, under Peter Dutton’s ill-fated citizenship revocation referendum, be eligible for deportation). But having a sellable energy policy and appearing to take climate change seriously are both crucial — especially if the Liberals are to have any hope of retrieving teal seats. This doesn’t necessarily require taking climate seriously: Labor under Anthony Albanese has mastered the art of looking like it believes in the need to address the climate crisis while significantly worsening it with colossal, and mostly untaxed, fossil fuel exports. But the Coalition at least needs to look like it believes in the basics of science. Peter Dutton’s energy and climate policy was an impressive achievement: a figleaf for climate denialism that also managed to trash core Liberal values and upset the party’s fossil fuel friends. Nuclear energy requires a monumental expansion in the role of the federal government, with costs running into the hundreds of billions, making it both a massive political target and a repudiation of the Liberals’ smaller government/free markets/fiscal discipline ethos. The gas reservation policy, hastily cobbled together as Dutton was walking into the House of Representatives to deliver his budget reply — intended to replace nuclear, given the latter had landed so badly with voters — only upset gas companies while contradicting the Liberals’ commitment to free markets. Voters didn’t even understand it. But nuclear was only the latest in a string of fake climate policies adopted by the Coalition to assure the Nationals and the old-man-yells-at-cloud base of the Liberal party that no-one really believes all that nonsense. Remember, the Coalition started with the policy gold standard on climate: after years of denialism, John Howard committed to a comprehensive carbon pricing scheme before the 2007 election. After Malcolm Turnbull was rolled by denialists for attempting to fulfil the Howard commitment, Tony Abbott adopted the risible “direct action” — handouts to Nationals voters for fake emissions abatement using scams like Human-Induced Regeneration — and a so-called “safeguard mechanism” you could drive a diesel-huffing truck through. After another interval in which a restored Turnbull tried to inject some rationality and evidence into Coalition climate policy, Scott Morrison embraced “net zero”, with a significant chunk of the path to said zero to be achieved by magical “new technology”. The transparency of this fake policy was a key driver in the seizure by centrist independents of heartland Liberal seats. Dutton’s nuclear policy suffered a similar fate. Still, in contrast to Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership, Abbott, Morrison and Dutton kept their party and the Coalition unified. For a time. What’s left for the Liberals in the “fake climate policies” cupboard? They could take nuclear to the 2028 election, as urged by the likes of Tim Wilson (the Adam Bandt of the Liberals, with the same irksome sanctimony and divisiveness that marked the now-former Greens leader). But the coal-fired power stations that policy is really designed to keep open will be three years older by then, and the transition to renewables, which nuclear was designed to shut down investment in, will be three years further advanced. It would also put the failure of the Liberals to learn the lessons of 2022 and 2025 up in lights. Or it could try to make a virtue of denialism by adopting a policy wholly focused on resilience: the world is getting hotter, we can’t stop it, so let’s invest in resilience. The benefit of that policy would be the appeal to the Nationals, since it would allow tens of billions of dollars for regional infrastructure boondoggles administered by a Nationals ministers. Once again, not likely to be a policy that would appeal to affluent urban voters, especially those living on the coast. But big on party unity. Alternatively, the new leadership could see that, given the dire state of the party inside and outside Parliament, a public display of disunity over energy policy wouldn’t make things any worse. In fact, it might make the moderates of the party look slightly less like the supine speedhumps to the right that they’ve been for fifteen years on this issue. Finally, they could show voters they had stood up and fought for a policy that recognised the reality of the climate crisis, rather than the reality of News Corp’s toxic stranglehold on much of the party and the Liberals’ reliance on the denialist Nationals to govern. There’ll never be a better time: the next election is three years away. Voters won’t be paying any attention to politics for a long time. The pieces can be picked up, the furniture put right, the toys returned to the cot next year. But business as usual will just deliver the same results for a party wholly resistant to change.

Ben Phillips, an associate professor at the Australian National University Centre for Social Research and Methods, says talk of a national rental crisis is “overblown”. They reflect how difficult and pricey it is to move rentals, or rent for the first time. What they don’t reflect is how much most of the roughly 3 million households with a lease are actually paying. ... And there, the picture is very different. “There are people who are struggling, but the talk of a generalised rental crisis is overblown,” he says. Hmmm, i've been away from the rental market for several decades, so my only guide all this time has been media, pollies, & analysts. This article is the first i've read that actively downplays the drama. It smells bad to me, in my ignorance, as it seems to just sweep the dreadful plight of some [which i'd hitherto thought of as many] renters under the statistical rug. # HousingCrisis # RentalCrisis # AusPol",

Instead of having to do the work involved in reporting on policy they could continue with the vacuous ‘Dutton said’ narratives that dominated the last term of government.

The Greens would be a far more effective opposition than these clowns - which is probably why so much $$ was directed to keeping them out of the lower house. With an irrelevant opposition & a Green senate we may get to focus on governance.

In terms of policy, Nationals seem to be overwhelmingly in charge getting their way across numerous policy areas - most notably nuclear -  but after the election, the numbers within the Coalition have dramatically swung in the Nationals' favour with the vast majority of seat losses suffered by their Liberal Party colleagues. In the House of Reps there are currently just 17 Libs (down 10) to 9 Nats (down 1), excluding the Queensland LNP that's a combined 16 of both (down 5). The Queenslanders, whether they sit in Liberal or National Party room, seem far more closely aligned with the National Party policies and its patrons such as Rinehart, than the  rest of the Coalition. Following the election, the centre of gravity for the Coalition has shifted even more starkly to Queensland and it's not a unreasonable conclusion that the leader of the National Party, a Queenslander, now enjoys more power in the Coalition arrangement than the leader of the Liberals. At what stage is the shift recognised with the Liberals formally becoming the junior Coalition partner in name as well as deed? https:// tallyroom.aec.gov.au/HouseDefa ult-31496.htm # auspol",

Little, though, has been made of an equivalent crisis of the left, if that word still serves to name those forces that define their role as progressive. Both share the new, yet unspoken, reality of Australian politics: that the ALP is no longer a party of the centre left but the new party of the centre right. However competent and formidable it might be, the party cannot disguise its move away from its more radical past by simply waving a Medicare card at every photo opportunity. Nature abhors a vacuum: as the Liberals mounted a Jack Russell race to the MAGA right, Labor moved into the high country they vacated. Labor abandoned any pretence of being a party of the environment, as it was in the ’70s, ‘80s and ’90s, and, if it still cosplays as being a party of social justice, its reforms are timid and piecemeal. Yet even if its leader seems to like arriving at a barbecue in a billionaire’s helicopter and its policies are deferential to corporate Australia, being centre right is, as the election confirmed, infinitely preferable for many more Australians than the dark MAGA fantasies of the Liberal Party, the same fantasies that are wreaking such destruction in the US and globally. But not being MAGA does not make Labor a party of progress. If Labor has ambitions, they are not of changing society but of preserving its own power into a third term by consolidating itself into the status quo of an increasingly unequal 21st century society as the new party of corporate Australia. Notwithstanding the MAGA lamentations of Gina Rinehart, as Elizabeth Knight, this masthead’s business columnist, noted: “That whoosh you heard on Sunday, as Labor did its victory lap, was a collective exhale of relief from the big end of town”. Knight goes on to report that as Westpac chief executive Anthony Miller “sees it, Australia has jumped to the top of the league tables as an attractive place for international business to invest and international talent to make a new home”. Labor’s victory is a paradox: Hawke won in 1983 with half the primary vote (49.5 per cent), while Albanese won last Saturday with just over a third (34.75 per cent) – a proportion that would have been seen as catastrophic 20 years ago. Labor’s great victory came not from the drying dam of its primary vote but the rivers of preferences flooding in from independent and Greens voters. In the opposite of a Reservoir D0gs Mexican stand-off where everyone points a pistol at everyone else and almost all die, the preferential system sees avowed enemies electing each other. Thus, Labor and the Liberals collude in preference deals where they are challenged by independents or Greens, yet Labor’s successes against the Liberals are bound up in getting Greens and independent preferences. Without them, the Liberal Party’s problems today could well be Labor’s in the not-so-distant future. Meanwhile, out on the now eerily emptied savannah of the left, the same paradox haunts what remains: fewer independents and Greens. And yet, the national vote for independents keeps going up and the federal Greens vote remains close to its peak. While the Greens harbour a romance of an alliance with Labor, that is ever less likely as Labor shifts further right and delights in its utter contempt for them. The Greens, though, like a spurned lover, keep seeking to be embraced by the ALP once more. As well as preferencing Labor in almost all electorates, the Greens went into the election sounding not like an environmental party but the unloved left of Labor – the same party that election after election uses the Greens for preference harvesting and then rejects its advances. Green-shaming is Labor’s political equivalent of slut-shaming. The only way out of this vicious dilemma that sees the two main parties continuing to decline as a popular force but dominate as an electoral force would seem to be some new alliance that seeks to create a closer working relationship between independents and Greens. With this kind of agreement, they would preference each other at elections rather than Labor, and work more closely together in parliament on the matters on which they are agreed. None of this would be easy: while voters have liked the crossbench co-operating on issues such as gambling reform and an integrity commission, they are less happy when they think an independent is electorally aligned with others. Despite the unremitting propaganda wheeled out through the election, independents are not Greens, and on many issues are far from the Greens’ positions, while the Greens in turn find some independents’ positions anathema. The problem for all is that the left is becoming an increasingly Balkanised landscape. The possibility of a new national ecology party forming to pursue the goals the Greens have abandoned only worsens the picture. Unless some way of coming together can be found, the alternative will be the spectre of the left’s growing irrelevance. In an Australia where the vote for non-major parties is the size of the vote for Labor – and growing – the crossbench could begin reimagining its ranks as the place out of which governments of the future can be built. If independents could re-conceive their roles not just as individual representatives but as future national leaders, finding within themselves the ambition to ultimately aspire to create a government of allies, they may escape being condemned to the sidelines of history and show the larger, as yet unrealised, possibilities of Australian democracy. In some ways, the plight of the left today mirrors the crisis in which crushed conservatives found themselves in the 1940s when Robert Menzies united 18 anti-Labor groups into a new, single force of conservatism that would become the most electorally successful federal political party in Australia’s history: the Liberals. Whether there is a comparable figure or figures on the left today who might bring together these disparate but important voices into some form of partnership or alliance that can hold Labor to account is a question only time can answer. But it is the question that must now be asked. Richard Flanagan won the 2014 Man Booker Prize for his novel The Narrow Road to the Deep North. In 2024, he won the Baillie Gifford Prize (for non-fiction) for his most recent book, Question 7. He is the first writer to win both prizes.

    "content": "https://www. smh.com.au/politics/federal/th e-liberals-must-make-peace-with-the-f-word-20250509-p5lxz9.html QUOTE BEGINS There is no greater confirmation of the Liberal Party’s inability to learn from its mistakes than a re-read of its 2022 election review. Such reviews are a convention on both sides of politics, and they (should) serve a sound purpose: the prosaic and simple purpose of learning history so as not to repeat it. The 2022 review, undertaken by former party director Brian Loughnane and Senator Jane Hume, contains many paragraphs that could be cut and pasted into the next review, covering the devastating loss the Liberals have just suffered. “The party has lost nearly all of its inner metropolitan seats,” reads one 2022 observation. “Of particular concern in the results is that in seats with high numbers of female professional voters, the Liberal Party only holds three of the top 30 seats where previously it held 15.” Then there is the conclusion that “the only demographic class where the Liberal Party and the National Party have a stronghold is in rural electorates”. And its blunt follow-up: “No party that is seeking to form government has a pathway to a majority solely through rural and regional electorates.” Further: “Liberal Party performed particularly poorly with female voters, continuing a trend that has been present since the election of 1996.” This is a kind way of saying that its share of the female vote has been falling for nearly two decades, with no serious attempts to arrest the decline. No acknowledgment, outside this review, that the lady-vote is not a boutique item, not an interest group or a minority to be pandered to, but instead, that it represents the numerical majority of voters. Also from the 2022 review: “A significant number of submissions to the review cited the Liberal Party’s declining vote among women as a decisive factor in the 2022 election loss. It is clear from the party’s research and post-election analysis that the party’s standing with women was an important factor in the party’s defeat.” Add the statement: “Liberal defectors in ‘Teal seats’ were highly likely to agree with the statement that ‘the treatment or attitude toward women within the Liberal Party had a strong influence on my vote’.” Or: “Immediately following the election, a clear majority of Australians (across different electorates) agreed with the statement that ‘the Liberal Party has fallen behind the views of middle Australia’.” There are sections on the swing against the Liberals among Chinese-Australian voters, and a warning that the Liberals’ policy agenda “appeared to be limited and unclear to the electorate”. There is a call for the proper vetting of candidates, and the preselection of candidates in good time to prepare for the election campaign. And then the most damning conclusion of all. “Many of the matters raised in this review were also discussed in the reviews of the 2016 and 2019 federal elections,” the authors write. “Many of the problems identified have been constants for a decade or more.” What now? At the time of writing, Deputy Liberal Leader Sussan Ley had declared her candidacy for the leadership. On Friday, she told the Sunrise program, “We did let the women of Australia down”. She continued: “I’m determined and convinced that I am the right person to lead the party forward at this time and I think my appointment would send a strong signal to the women of Australia, but it’s about much more than that.” Even in this brief statement, you can read the internal conflict of the Liberals: We know we have done a bad job with women, and we know we need to promote them to positions of leadership. But we can’t allow the impression to settle that they are promoted to positions of leadership because they are women. The conservative side of politics, in Australia and abroad, has always had difficulty embracing the values of feminism. In its furthermost right quarters, women are valued chiefly for their roles as homemakers and mothers, with a reluctant concession that some women have something to offer the public sphere. Former prime minister Tony Abbott eventually put out a replacement-wage maternity leave policy with the explanation that women should not be educated to a high level, only to be denied a career. “If we want women of that calibre to have families, and we should, well we have to give them a fair dinkum chance to do so. That is what this scheme of paid parental leave is all about,” he said in 2013. In 2014, then-minister for foreign affairs Julie Bishop rejected the label “feminist” for herself. “I don’t find the need to self-describe in that way,” she told the National Press Club. Feminist, she said, “is not a term that I find particularly useful these days”. She said she would never “blame the fact that I’m a woman” if something didn’t work out in her career. And yet, it is difficult to conjure any reason other than her gender to explain why Bishop was never treated seriously as a leadership contender by her own (majority male) colleagues. The Labor Party has achieved gender parity in parliament (if not in high leadership positions) through the effective implementation of quotas. The right side of politics has an anathema for the Q word, even though Liberals have, for years now, tentatively used the more gentle word “targets” to assert they are onto the problem of the gross under-representation of women in their ranks. The Liberals should be the party of aspiration, and the party of peak economic productivity. Quotas are productive – in the sense that they work, and they work quickly. Feminism is a byword for female aspiration – the aspiration for what countless politicians like to call the Australian principle of the “fair go”. Why is that F-word so ubiquitous, while the other one is so difficult for Liberals to utter? QUOTE ENDS # AusPol # WhyIsLabor # HahahahaLiebs # NatsAreNuts # OzElection2025",

    "content": "Along with being both a federal and state Labor MP, Dr Race Mathews was a passionate advocate for the idea that in a just society, businesses should be owned by their workers or customers through credit unions and co-operative societies: https://bccm.coop/vale-the-hon-dr-race-mathews/ # auspol # vicpol # cooperatives # capitalism # socialism # business \"Dr Race Mathews was a former Victorian and federal politician, a labour historian and an Australian co-operative economist. Dr Mathews was born in Hawthorn, Victoria in 1935. His first job was as a clerk for the Shell Oil Company, before going on to work as a primary school teacher, and a speech therapist. A long career in politics and academia followed. Dr Mathews held numerous positions in the Australian Labor Party and the co-operative and credit union movements and wrote extensively on their history, attributes and accomplishments. \"Dr Mathews joined the ALP in 1956 and served as chief of staff to Gough Whitlam and Labor leaders in the Victorian Parliament before he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1972. From 1972 to 1975, Dr Mathews was the Federal Member for Casey in the Whitlam Government, where he served as chairman of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties and chairman of the Government Members’ Committee on Urban and Regional Development. \"From 1979 to 1992, Dr Mathews served in the Victorian Legislative Assembly as the Member for Oakleigh. During the Premiership of John Cain, he served as chairman of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Co-operatives, and held a number of portfolios including Minister for Community Services, Minister for Police and Emergency Services and Minister for the Arts. \"In his academic career, Dr Mathews held positions at Government and Business Schools at the universities of Monash, Deakin and Kent State in the United States. A major focus for his research was the complex of worker-owned co-operatives of the Mondragon Corporation in the Basque region of Spain and its origins in the social teachings of the Catholic Church. Mondragon was extensively referenced in his book Of Labour and Liberty: Distributism in Victoria 1891-1966 and was the core focus of his previous work, Jobs of Our Own: Building a Stake-Holder Society. \"Referring to Mondragon, Dr Mathews stated: \"'All my life I’ve been on the hunt for good ways of making a better world – making life more rewarding for ordinary people … [I was delighted to hear in the 1980s that] something extraordinary was going on in an obscure valley in the Basque region of Spain.' Dr Mathews also wrote important works on credit unions including: * Credit Unions and the New Mutualism, * Where Credit Is Due, * Reinvigorating Credit Union Mutuality, and * A Future or No Future: Credit Unions in a Globalising Economy. Dr Mathews was a significant contributor to numerous topics including Mutualism, Distributism, Labour Movement History and Public Policy.

In places like Melbourne and Wills, we have to outpoll both major parties combined. That’s always been a huge ask. Remarkably, we’ve done it before, not just in Federal Melbourne but also in state seats like Melbourne, Richmond, Brunswick, and Newtown. But it’s no small task. \"In order to be successful, MPs need to build broad coalitions in their electorates to appeal to 50% of voters across different generations, cultures, and backgrounds. Labor MPs often do this by standing for as little as possible, and some commentators will now tell us that we need to do the same. But Adam [Bandt] showed us a different way. He built those coalitions without compromising our values. \"His team paired smart and genuine grassroots ground work with values-based work in Canberra and the media. Adam stood up for young people and renters, and for our poor and multicultural communities in public housing, while also building trust with older voters who care about the future, the environment and their local neighbourhood. It wasn’t either or. \"Political pundits right now are full of advice about how the Greens should change our ways to appeal to this broad coalition — that we should talk less about Gaza, renters, or coal. Curiously, these are often the same people who used to tell us to talk more about the economy and less about climate change! \"What they don’t understand is something fundamental to who we are as Greens: unlike the major parties we’re not here to win for winning’s sake.\"",

    "content": "https://www. canberratimes.com.au/story/896 3311/kenny-lessons-from-labors-success-and-liberals-defeat/ QUOTE BEGINS First is obvious. He may not be Australia's most seductive rhetorician, but Anthony Albanese is the nation's pre-eminent politician. Soon to mark three decades in Canberra, Labor's unfashionable parliamentary stayer proved he is a tungsten tough leader who focused laser-like on the median voter and managed variables with more foresight than any politician since John Howard. His chief irritants on right and left were defeated so thoroughly that each was banished from the Parliament, their parties routed and decapitated. Key among his distinguishing attributes, argues my colleague, Dr Marija Taflaga, is an uncommon capacity for \"strategic waiting\". A second thought is this. After smashing a 21-year run of Australian PMs not making it to a second term, Albanese nudges hero status within Australia's oldest party in one of the world's oldest democracies. Not too shabby for a political figure derided by progressives as a tinkerer and by the right as not up to the demands of national security. Third. The Liberals' delusion of a new suburban backlash was years in the making. After their worst defeat in 2022, the party commissioned a review, read its recommendations on things like women and getting policy out in time, and then studiously ignored the lot. Indeed, Peter Dutton flagged what would prove to be his epic vote-shedding strategy in his first bullish statement as leader. Nobody in the Liberal or Nationals party rooms said boo. Fourth. The very existence of the Liberal Party cannot be assumed. Don't be fooled by the exaggerated protestations of those within its remnant parliamentary ranks who insist they will bounce back. Of course they must say this. But political parties have come and gone before. It was only when R G Menzies created the Liberal Party as an amalgam of non-Labor interests in the 1940s that what we regard as permanent came to be. The Liberal-Nationals Coalition has held office for 52 of the 81 years since its formation. It was, as Christopher Pyne liked to skite, \"a vote-winning machine\". That era is going the way of baby boomers who now constitute the party's shrinking conservative base. Fifth. Personnel matters. Leadership matters. The 2022 loss of the saleable liberal, Josh Frydenberg, licensed the ideological careen under Dutton that would render the Liberals irrelevant to most urban voters in this election and the next. Recognising this is the threshold challenge for rescuing the party's pragmatic-conservative value proposition to voters. Talk is not sufficient. It now needs to visibly demonstrate change by walking the walk. Sussan Ley is the logical choice right now. She proposes to \"meet the Australian people where they are\". This is the only sensible message to agree on internally if there is to be any hope of credibly communicating it externally. Opting for the right-wing fantasy ticket of Angus Taylor and Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa-Price (the darling of Sky \"after dark\") would transmit the insane assessment that, in fact, Dutton had not been hard-line enough. Sixth. Dutton was at war with the media. This was revealing. While relentlessly branding Albanese weak, it was Dutton who dogged the standard rigours required of high office. If he truly coveted the nation's top job, he would have buried his animosity, deep-sixed his rancorous \"hate media\" gibes, and fronted up to frequent Parliament House press conferences and interviews. The tougher the better. And he would have appeared at the National Press Club in the final week of the campaign per the Australian election tradition. The PM did. It was combative, but effective. Seventh. Albanese read Dutton's media cowardice like a book, granting the Liberal leader no less than four televised election debates. Two is common, four is unprecedented. This reflected Albanese's confidence that Dutton was underdone on policy, not match-fit for testing public interchanges, and that Dutton's abundant aggression would be his undoing with ordinary voters. All proved correct. Eight. The flagrant campaign for the Coalition, hammered nightly by Sky News, materially distorted its offering. Its foaming zealotry might have provided Dutton with a happy place for softball interviews, but these foghorns coaxed the Coalition into a resentful anti-woke cul-de-sac rent with scoffing cynicism and partisan \"common sense\". The various ways in which this febrile barracking separated the Coalition from ordinary Australian voters are legion, but prominent examples include its absurd government-funded nuclear policy, its belatedly dumped work-from-home ban, a proposed referendum to give ministers deportation powers over migrants, and a nasty populist plan not to create unemployment in Canberra rather than jobs. Nine. The Greens party's always grandiose claims to be an emerging force in the House of Representatives are over. For good. Their demise proved what was already known - that holding together a broad electoral constituency - rather than just a highly motivated section of it - requires nuance and compromise. A party of indignant protest cannot be both broad-based and narrowly pure. Tenth. Moderate NSW Liberal senator Maria Kovacic is correct - nuclear is a dead duck and always was. The new Liberal leader should immediately declare the climate wars over. They lost. Sovereign risk for renewables investment would evaporate were there a Coalition commitment to work with Labor on the energy transition. Oh, the warning? Big electoral shifts connote future volatility. Just like early voting, if you've done it once ...

    "content": "The Coalition and the real hate media https://www. thesaturdaypaper.com.au/commen t/topic/2025/05/09/the-coalition-and-the-real-hate-media QUOTE BEGINS As editor of the British tabloid rag The Sun in the 1980s, Kelvin MacKenzie had a favourite description of how to make the lives of public figures unpleasant – his journalists were instructed to “stick a ferret up their trousers”. It’s a matter of legend that whenever an editorial line proved unpopular (never mind wrong) MacKenzie would burst from his office, shouting, “Reverse ferret!” This might as well have been the catchphrase of last weekend, the Murdoch outlets having so thoroughly championed a party so deeply unloved by the electorate at large. It should finally be recognised that Sky News and certain newspapers are no longer news services, and they are in part responsible for the resounding thrashing of Peter Dutton and his team. No less complicit are some aggressive and out-of-touch talkback radio stations. For a long time, these outlets have operated as the media arm of the Coalition, seeing themselves as players in a political game. They chose their champions, kicked their foes and obfuscated any debate. Our country is poorer today as a result. For the past three years, they have found it impossible to admit they lost the previous election, let alone genuinely look at why. They have learnt nothing and did it all again this time. Operating from within the same vacuum, sustaining lies and hatred and simply refusing to listen to any other opinions, ideas or policies. Pretending that Albanese was invisible for nearly three years turned out to be a fatal flaw in their plan. For three years these outlets insisted the prime minister was doing nothing, not getting the right meetings, or simply absent. They sustained these fallacies by refusing to report real news on what he was actually doing about the cost of living, energy and so on, all the while crowing about the great alternative in their mate “Dutts”, even insisting the opposition leader was “running the show”. Even the bookies believed their bullshit, such has been the power of the press. Then disaster. Five weeks out, as campaigning hit its straps, they had to actually report in real time what the prime minister was doing, every day. This bit hard. He had policies that he could back up, he was confident and composed, in charge, on top of the detail, and he connected easily with people from all walks of life. They couldn’t have got this more wrong. Here was the real deal, a Rabbitohs supporter from the burbs, a genuine fan of Australian rock. Having kept him hidden for so long, they simply couldn’t handle the reality, or the competition. Overall, throughout the campaign, the media tended to dumb down the political discourse, focusing more on its entertainment value – the colour and movement – and ignoring policy. Those who travelled on the buses with the leaders were easily constrained by the leaders’ messages of the day, unwilling or unable to dig into the detail behind them. At best, they hoped for a “gotcha” moment or some crowd disruption in the daily presser to supply just enough grabs for the evening news. All this suited Dutton and his News Corp mates. He would simply claim he’d fix the economy and control inflation, be the leader who restored home ownership and the Australian dream, knowing he would never be called on for the detail but could expect headlines for the claims. By comparison, on the Labor side, Australians also got to see a well-functioning, unified front bench. Thus far the good and exhaustive work done by the likes of Jim Chalmers, Penny Wong and Don Farrell had gone unheralded, totally ignored and misrepresented along the way. If they were ever mentioned it was, at best, rude; at worst, bordering on defamatory. Chris Bowen was described continually by one particularly grubby radio host in the most obscene way, slurs picked up enthusiastically by hosts at Sky News. Which is why it was so jarring, as the campaign unfolded, to see an increasingly desperate Dutton calling both the ABC and Guardian Australia “hate media”. In no way did they approximate the vitriol of the right-wing press and, as for coverage, his claims of bias were staggering given the total support and saturation coverage of his clearly under-prepared team. It is noteworthy that the assessment of the election result by both former prime minister Tony Abbott and his former chief of staff and now Sky News host Peta Credlin was there should have been more culture wars. More hate. The nightly bias, spit and bile rants led by Chris Kenny, Andrew Bolt, Credlin, Paul Murray and the rest were designed to influence talking points and form strategy for the alternative government. Dutton built his leadership on a revamp of the Abbott–Credlin disaster, pursuing negativity and divisiveness on every issue and seeking to undermine the credibility of Albanese and his government. He refused to see any merit in any idea or initiative, whether it was in the country’s interests or not. Dutton persisted with this strategy, expecting to build on the success he’d enjoyed in thwarting the Indigenous Voice to Parliament referendum, supported by his media chorus. This was a miscalculation; these votes were never going to be transferrable. However, that said, Sky News, with their audience of frankly two and a dog, is not even the main culprit here. The print media was complicit, clearly forming the basis of much of the drivel that ran on the Murdoch-owned news channel. A daily visit to our local coffee shop told the story. Every day, The Australian and The Daily Telegraph in particular heralded glowing near-achievements of Peter Dutton, alongside thinly veiled attacks on Bowen, Chalmers and Wong. It was also astonishing to see television debates awarded to Sky, all of which were poorly run, one-sided embarrassments, along with the soft, sop-piece interview with Paul Murray. That was unedifying and probably embarrassing even to Peter Dutton himself. Channel Seven’s debate and subsequent election coverage was well considered, entertaining and featured good panels and fair hosting. The guests were polite and informative without the hate-filled representations found on some other networks. When it came to Dutton boldly declaring in that debate that a dozen eggs cost $4.20, Albanese’s reply was an affable correction of his opponent (albeit he was still short by a dollar), showing a viewing public that he did understand the cost of living. That said, surely we can hope future debates of such importance will be conducted by the national broadcaster and available to all Australians. I feel it’s important to point out the ABC was a clear winner on election night, with ratings holding the top three spots by miles. Despite sustained attacks, the national broadcaster remains Australia’s most-trusted news source. In all of this, the newspapers have ignored their responsibility to focus on the truth. They exaggerated, misrepresented and tried to shape the country’s future to suit their own agendas, but all they really succeeded in doing was failing the public. They simply ignored their responsibilities and didn’t report the news. Australians, they obviously felt, were not entitled to facts or to form their own opinions and make up their own minds. Surely the influence of these ignorant media stooges has to come to an end. They are simply gauche entertainment for their MAGA devotees. The magnitude of this election victory in the face of such adversity must surely call into question their continuing relevance. Sadly, we had to wait until Dutton’s concession speech to see the best of the opposition leader, when he seemed actually to be more at ease, perhaps more himself. What a pity. Much has been made of the election result in the post-mortem and wash-up. It was catastrophic, the Liberal Party with barely any representation in the major capital cities is now simply a regional party without a regional strategy. Much can and will be made of how it came to this, but I can’t help but wonder what might have been. It’s not inconceivable that the likes of Allegra Spender could have been shadow treasurer and Monique Ryan shadow health minister, within a party far more widely in tune with women and youth, if they had been allowed to find a place within the Liberals. It’s not simply a matter of changing leader; the whole parliamentary team have to be engaged in policy development. It was arrogant to pretend the election could have been won simply by being negative and divisive, with poor planning and thin policies. While the Liberal Party’s identity as a broad church was always aspirational, this is exactly what the party now needs to be. If they have learnt anything from recent history, it should be that they can’t take voters for granted. QUOTE ENDS # AusPol # WhyIsLabor # HahahahaLiebs # NatsAreNuts # OzElection2025",

THE REAL VICTORY to come out of the 2025 Federal Election is the record number of women who will make up the nation’s new parliament. . It's a sign of the times, but it also marks a shifting voter base that has no qualms in swiping right on representatives for as long as it takes to find the right one. . These aren't policies. These are views, where policies should be. Women in need of safety and security. Women in need of a protector to ward off the dangers their environment poses to them: homelessness, domestic violence, relationships. . Incidentally, these descriptions are not of women, either. They are descriptions of ideas about women. Dutton doesn't see women as people because he doesn't see them at all. It's not that women aren't equal — it's that they aren't real. To Dutton, they are an absraction. . Children, in Dutton's world view, are a vulnerability — worthy of protection but not worthy of more. For the women who get put in the same basket as their children, the Opposition Leader could not sound more paternalistic. . Nothing could feel more condescending than a man, who will not shift his world view to include you in it. Not even when directly asked. . Equality exists for the Liberals but only conceptually. They can't implement it. How could they? Their policies for women sound as invented as their ideas about them — hollow, but mostly, imaginary. They can't be applied to the real world. They'd have to reflect real life first. . If a party's political platform is anti-diversity, then it may as well brand itself as inbred. For a party that decides diversity is the new enemy, how will it receive new input? With no new input, the party denies itself the chance to ever correct itself, to learn by trial and error or to learn at all. It robs itself of the chance to improve on the past. Ultimately, it won't. # AusPol # WhyIsLabor # HahahahaLiebs # NatsAreNuts # OzElection2025",

A second-term Anthony Albanese government has no excuse not to raise welfare payments in a cost-of-living and housing crisis. The welfare system is so broken that, according to the government’s own Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), those on JobSeeker and the Disability Support Pension (DSP) make up a third of adult suicide deaths. Between 2011 and 2021, rates of death by suicide for age groups between 16 and 65 years were highest among those who received the DSP. For those between 16 and 45 years old, suicide was highest among people on unemployment payments. # AusPol # WhyIsLabor # HahahahaLiebs # NatsAreNuts # OzElection2025",

    "content": "https://www. canberratimes.com.au/story/896 2371/climate-200-backed-independent-jessie-price-shakes-up-bean/ QUOTE BEGINS It's the shock federal election result that has rattled ACT Labor and could herald a new era for the so-called community independents movement, with its rallying cry of \"no safe seats\". In the formerly safe Labor seat of Bean, independent candidate Jessie Price has obliterated Labor incumbent MP David Smith's 12.9 per cent margin and appears on the cusp of winning with 50.09 per cent of the two-candidate preferred vote - although postal votes are still being counted. With all election day and pre-poll ballot papers counted, Ms Price is ahead by just 165 votes on Friday afternoon - a trend that, if it continues, would make her the first Climate 200-backed independent to steal a Labor seat. While the final result could take weeks, she declares \"the community of Bean has won\" and that voters in the electorate, in Canberra's south, can no longer be ignored. So how did a midwife and former journalist achieve such a feat, at an election that expanded the Albanese government's parliamentary majority in a landslide Labor victory? Ms Price says she ran a positive campaign and that, when talking with people in the community, \"we've had a real sense of how keen people are for change\", while acknowledging that her two-candidate preferred result is buoyed by Liberal and Greens preferences. Depending on who you talk to, the result in Bean is an example of people power in action, or an accident of the preferential voting system. Either way, it's sure to give encouragement to the Voices independent movement in the territory and elevate the concerns of voters who say they've been forgotten. In March, Climate 200 founder Simon Holmes a Court declared the seat of Bean in play, citing polling showed \"strong support\" for Ms Price and saying ACT voters had an appetite for community independents thanks to the popularity of ACT senator David Pocock. But when she quickly overtook Liberal candidate David Lamerton in the two-candidate preferred race on election night to emerge as a potential winner of Bean, many political commentators were taken by surprise. Ms Price has declared $54,000 in funding from Climate 200 and says about $110,000 was raised through small donations in the community, saying her campaign has been far leaner than Senator Pocock's $1.8 million bid to blast former Liberal senator Zed Seselja out of the Senate in 2022. Her highly organised campaign counts more than 250 volunteers, who've spent months doorknocking and campaigning at local shopping centres and markets, while maintaining a strong social media presence. \"Every volunteer has been letter boxing, out talking with people in their community, just putting in such an effort to get our own community independent up, and it really has come through because of that people power,\" Ms Price says. Bean constituents who spoke to The Canberra Times at Tuggeranong's Southpoint shopping centre this week have a variety of views on how the once-safe Labor territory came under siege. Bonython's Elizabeth Parr, who voted for the Liberal Party, says she preferenced Ms Price over Labor to \"keep as many of them [Labor MPs] out of parliament as possible.\" \"When I read her [Ms Price's] policies, I thought she was another teal or greenie disguised. She was funded by Climate 200, and I'm not into the whole thing about climate change, but she seems very nice,\" she says. Ms Parr says it was \"unwise\" for then opposition leader Peter Dutton to propose getting rid of public servants and that he'd run a \"very disappointing campaign\". \"I'm very, very sad that Australians voted for the ALP,\" she says. Keiran, 24, who works at Tuggeranong, says he did not know either candidate but voted for the Greens. \"Being real with us [voters] is the most important thing to me. I hate it when anything is sugar-coated,\" he says. Denis McDermott has lived in the nearby suburb of Conder for 25 years. The long-time ALP supporter says he was surprised Mr Smith did not breeze back into his seat after a comfortable win in 2022 but believes \"complacency\" is behind the swing towards Ms Price. \"David Pocock as an independent has really captured the imagination,\" he says. \"People have seen what an independent can do.\" So compelling was Ms Price's pitch to progressives in Canberra's south that she attracted dozens of volunteers from among Greens members - leaving the minor party's candidate Sam Carter to campaign alone at times as supporters switched allegiances. \"A lot of those people said they identified Jessie as a stronger prospect for election,\" he tells this masthead. At the ballot box, a 5.62 per cent swing was recorded against the Greens, with Mr Carter attracting just 9.18 per cent of first preference votes. Liberal candidate David Lamerton suffered a 6.71 per cent swing to record 23.01 per cent of the primary vote, attributed at least in part to then Opposition Leader Peter Dutton's campaign pledge to cut the Australian public service by 41,000 employees \"in Canberra\". Mr Smith barely suffered a swing, polling just 0.74 per cent fewer first-preference votes than in 2022, attracting 40.99 per cent - by far the largest proportion - of the primary vote in Bean. Ms Price, who polled 26.81 per cent of the primary vote, was preferenced above Labor by both the Liberals and Greens - with the latter prompting ACT Labor to print off how-to-vote cards urging Greens voters in Bean to put Labor second. She says if she's declared as the Bean MP, she will \"draw on the good ideas from right across the political spectrum\". Mr Smith, the second-term Labor MP for Bean, has been criticised for not being visible enough as a local member and he did himself no favours by skipping a candidate forum in March. In the final weeks of the election campaign, he was able to announce a $3.8 million Albanese government pre-election pledge to save the Interchange health co-operative, which provides bulk-billed GP care to vulnerable patients in Tuggeranong. But it may prove insufficient to counter Ms Price's campaign message that an independent is the best hope for voters in the seat. On budget night in March, the independent candidate was ready to deliver her critique on behalf of Bean voters, calling out a lack of funding to fix local roads, such as Hindmarsh Drive. Mr Smith, who says he has worked hard for his constituents, focused his campaign on stopping Mr Dutton from forming government. He says the collapse in the Liberal vote took him by surprise. \"Normally it would be a badge of honour for me not to get many votes with Liberal preferences.\" QUOTE ENDS # AusPol # HahahahaLiebs # WhyIsLabor # NatsAreNuts # OzElection2025",

    "content": "https://www. canberratimes.com.au/story/896 2377/waterford-albaneses-boldness-and-duttons-resignation-explained/ QUOTE BEGINS Some of the most memorable best political speeches made in Australia are made by politicians going out of office. Kim Beazley gave a cracker when leaving Parliament, and fairly good ones conceding defeat by John Howard in 1988 and 2001. It was said that if he had been able to move and inspire people and rally troops during his political lifetime, he would not have been spending so much time acknowledging his and his party's failures. Victory speeches are usually a bit more humdrum, even if given before an excited and jubilant crowd. For starters those who craft them (the speechwriters usually prepare two, one for victory, one for defeat) feel obliged to include cliché phrases such as \"great honour,\" \"humbled and with a deep feeling of responsibility\" ... \"We will govern for all Australians\", and \"tomorrow we will hit the ground running\". The credit and acknowledgements, win or lose, to campaign staff, party organisers, fallen comrades, and family, these days run longer than the credits on an Oscar-winning movie. Anthony Albanese's speech contained all of this, from a template borrowed, I think, from William Morris Hughes 110 years ago. Optimism, hope and substance are often the first things edited out. Even more from a leader, a government that has seemed timid about its social commitments and its moral duties. But a triumphant, if modest, Albanese unleashed the puppy. There was something in the middle that was worth notice. It reached no heights of oratory. Albanese doesn't do fluency or silken words - or read them well if someone else penned them. He has no great or fast wit, though he can see further through a brick wall than most and knows immediately if someone has stumbled. But his meanings are genuine enough. He usually believes in what he is saying. That is, if he is not merely going through the motions, as he is perhaps when reading some of the 10 speeches or statements he gives a day. His was not a speech brimming with statistics. He was not explaining why his aspirations for human betterment were low. He was not being defensive or resorting to redefinitions. Nor did he use the language of economics or rationing. He did not act as if the laws of economics decreed that an input of X here produced a Y somewhere else, self-evidently a good thing. Compared with some percentage of the gross domestic product there, which would have this effect on interest rates. Nor did he pander to ideas about lifting and leaning and the idea that half the population are not real citizens because they do not contribute. His words did not have to be parsed to be sure that they excised words of legal entitlement or subsumed previously made threats of disentitlement - the stuff of robodebt under a previous regime. Albo addressed citizens, not the forces of production, and in inclusive language. The speech was general and inclusive in its scope. It actually spoke to people. To individuals. To families and communities. Even to the whole nation. It did not seek to divide the population into them and us. It used the words \"you\" and \"us\". There was nothing particularly remarkable about what was said, other than it gave some hint of what government was all about. \"When it comes to Australia's future, all of us have so much reason to be optimistic,\" Albanese said. \"Because when we look at everything going on around the world today, when we consider the changes that will be the future of the world economy, when we think about our people and their smarts and truly there is nowhere else you would rather be than right here ... \"This is a time of profound opportunity for our nation. We have everything we need to seize this moment and make it our own. And we must do it together, all of us. Because for Australia to realise our full potential, for our nation to be the very best, every Australian must have the opportunity to be their best. To serve Australian values, we must value every Australian. Every Australian who wants a fair go at work, fair wages for their work, and the right to disconnect when they are done with work. Every Australian who deserves the security of a roof over their head or who dreams of owning their own home. Every woman who wants her contribution to our economy and society to be valued equally. \"Every parent who wants their child to get the best start in life, with cheaper childcare and with fair funding for every student in every school. Everyone who counts on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. \"We will be a government for every Australian who wants to train or re-train for new skills and a good job at public TAFE. Every Australian who works hard for the life-changing opportunity of higher education ...\" These are not, of themselves, new campaign commitments. But one would be entitled to assume that it implied that social expenditure, on health, education and social services, was at the top of the government's list of things to do. And not merely because a pollster or an economist had said that this was the main priority but because these were among the key reasons why we have government at all. Defence, law and order, industry policy and infrastructure provision are important, including in meeting the social commitments. They are words that Albanese has said before. But he has nicely put them forward in a bold manner, rather than, as he has sometimes seemed to do, apologised for the way these priority commitments fall into our cost of living. At least, one might say, he has repudiated the idea that the bag of money for health, welfare and education can be raided to meet our absurd defence commitments, salmon farms in Tasmania or new coal plants. Peter Dutton must have known he had lost long before his concession speech. But he was in a world of pain from the rejection he had received, firstly by his own electorate and from the whole nation. He showed some guts and some decency in accepting responsibility for the verdict on his campaign, and in praising the Labor candidate, Ali France, who now held his seat. But he eschewed any opportunity for any reflection on what the election result meant, or a defence of his philosophy or his party's philosophy. He gave no short account of what had brought him into politics, and why he thought he had been rejected by the silent Australians. He expressed no regrets for taking actions in his ministry which had seemed gratuitously cruel to people who had come to Australia for safety from persecution and war. Nor did he express any regret for some of his polarising statements which attacked disadvantaged Australians, including Indigenous Australians, refugees, immigrants and juvenile offenders. It may be that he has no regrets, though some of his supporters have always insisted that there is, behind that hard-man face, a man of decency, empathy and feeling for others. Perhaps he judged that this was not the occasion. He was certainly aware that his pollsters had told him that his very personality and character were campaign issues, and that many of those he had alienated feared or despised him. Of course, it is true that few men or women leave politics of their own choosing. Ask some of the Greens, about whose fate Albanese jeered even as he was calling for respect for the demolished Dutton. Albanese, obviously, has a thing against the Greens, even as he hopes and expects that they will support Labor legislation in the Senate, and even as he has relied on Green preferences to create his majority government. He must differentiate the Labor product from the Green, but the lack of proportion in the way that he does so ought to serve as a reminder that he has yet to stamp his place in history, even as the Greens have ensured their own. For the moment, however, observers should notice, and applaud some hint of passion, boldness, defiance and unwillingness to give an inch on core values. Previously, he had a tiny majority. Now he has a big one that ought to foreshadow a new resolution. Perhaps a transformation of the sort delivered by the Great Oz to the lion, the scarecrow and the woodman. We need more of the passion that admirers said was worn on his sleeves. Perhaps that is evident to his colleagues and friends, but it has not been obvious to ordinary Australians. We need more courage, more common sense and more heart. But we also need a new communication between the prime minister and the electorate. We need him thinking aloud. We need him being open to discussion about the merits and demerits of policies, rather than holding everything to his chest. We need him talking aloud, explaining what he is doing and why. And why he is not doing other things on the agenda. The government ought to be in a continuous dialogue with the governed. If the prime minister is shy, secretive and distrustful of the electorate, more junior and open ministers cannot substitute. Or dare to. Most politicians go into politics because they want to make a difference to people's lives. Whatever side one is on, it is not usually about power or the mechanical ways of making others conform to your will or seeing your logic. Nor is it to provide the opportunity for graft and corruption. The attraction is that many of the things in politics matter. Individuals, parties and the political process can make a difference, can change lives and outcomes. It is because politics involves choice and the division of the pie, and because there is never enough pie for everyone. It's why able and ambitious politicians put up with the bastardries, the public disdain of their profession and their kind, and the suspicion of their motives and their honesty. Why they elbow their colleagues aside in quests for power and engage in character assassination. Why they engage in fake debates, pretending sometimes that relatively innocuous statements outrage public decency. It's the heart in politics which speaks to character. Some politicians are very wary of displaying any heart or any emotion. That may lead to empathy and draw people to you. But it may drive others away or be seen to represent weakness and vulnerability. The risk-averse will cower. Fundamental character, heart, and passion, and motivating force can be just the ingredient worth looking for. In the modern day, there is often a vacuum at the surface. Many decisions do not come from deep conviction or ideology, but experience, relatively sensible management of people and things. It may soon be done by AI. The vision stuff, the philosophy stuff, and the priority stuff, are not mere baggage. They are usually the only things that make politicians human. For the humans on whose goodwill politicians depend, affection will depend on humanity they display, not their technical skill, their managerialist mantras or the demands that we should trust them.

    "content": "https://www. crikey.com.au/2025/05/09/clima te-200-candidates-election/ QUOTE BEGINS An evergreen point of clarification: Climate 200 does not select candidates or run independent campaigns. The funding aggregator supports community-nominated indies, trying to ensure donors’ money goes where it’s most effective. It unfortunately bears repeating, since so much of the media refuses to accept that convenor Simon Holmes à Court is not the movement’s “puppet master”, or even a major donor, contributing only a small fraction of the money raised, which is itself only a portion of each independent’s piggy bank. That said, Climate 200 was supporting a lot of candidates this year — 35, according to its website. So how’d it do? You probably haven’t heard much, in part because there haven’t been any big wins, like in 2022, when blue-ribbon seats fell like dominoes. But seven of the eight incumbents that Climate 200 supported retained their seats, with the exception of Zoe Daniel, who lost to an insanely determined Tim Wilson (previous beneficiaries David Pocock and Zali Steggall forewent funding this time, “graduating” from the mothership). Sophomores Sophie Scamps, Kate Chaney and Allegra Spender all increased their margins — no small feat given the resources thrown at defeating the “teals”. Of the 27 candidates who Climate 200 helped contest seats, the best chance of a win is in Bean in the ACT, where midwife Jessie Price is narrowly ahead of Labor. Kate Hulett gave Labor a scare in Fremantle, after doing the same at the state level, showing climate-focused independents are coming for both sides — with a message for Anthony Albanese, should he choose to heed it. But it was a disappointing night for return favourites Alex Dyson and Caz Heise, regional indies I spoke to for Well Hung. “Shadow member for Bradfield” Nicolette Boele is still in the race, just. There are still six Liberal-held seats where the independent could pull through: Bradfield, Monash, Flinders, Grey, Fisher and Forrest. Any of these could flip if preferences flow in the independent’s favour, with the AEC conducting a record number of 3CP counts (Grey is particularly close). And yet indies may end up falling short in all six. Asked on Thursday night about Climate 200’s success rate, Holmes à Court says the numbers are still in flux. But a seat or two could make a world of difference to how the result is read. “If the crossbench had lost three [community independents], people would say, ‘Oh, that was just a Morrison-fuelled bubble and it was never a real thing,’” he says. “But if it went forward three seats, the media would be writing, ‘This is a genius movement, the movement’s here to stay, and it’s a fundamental realignment of Australian democracy’ … The difference between those two extremes is a thousand votes in half a dozen seats. If you win or lose, it’s seen as everything, but it’s still only a few hundred votes.” Even without wins, there are impressive swings. First-time candidate Michelle Milthorpe cut Sussan Ley’s margin from 16.4% to just over 5% — something now being splashed across Liberal leadership shit sheets. The same goes for the LNP’s Fisher, where Keryn Jones looks set to finish second — though the AEC is still showing a Labor/LNP count. “There’s no silver medal in politics, but if they did hand out medals, 22 community groups would be walking away with gold or silver after last weekend,” says Holmes à Court. But politics is, as they say, a numbers game. ALP powerbroker Don Farrell has been out gloating about their majority, telling the Daily Telegraph the “teals can’t blackmail us” now. And there’s no avoiding the disappointments in Cowper and Wannon — the latter of which received a significant chunk of funds, yet saw a slight 2CP swing to the Libs, bucking the trend. Some suggest Climate 200 is wasting its resources in the country, where the “teal” association may hurt more than it helps. After all, a regional indie did win big this election, in Calare — just not the Climate 200-backed one. On future strategy, Holmes à Court offers no comment, but points to the thousands of local donors who also wanted better representation in these areas, saying Climate 200’s 33,000 donors were proud to help. So how does he feel overall, given the fact this was clearly not Climate 200’s election? “The movement has come out even stronger than it was at the end of 2022,” he says, noting that 1 million people voted independent this election — up from 776,000 in 2022. “So many metrics have moved in the right direction.” While the Greens went backwards in this election, Holmes à Court is certain climate is still important to Australian voters, pointing to how Liberal Andrew Constance inadvertently raised $1 million for the group after suggesting the Coalition would abandon the commitment to set a 2035 emissions target. “That, plus our internal polling, showed that climate was never off the table,” he says. “A lot of media like to think that voters could only hold the idea of cost of living in their heads and nothing else. But if you ask people questions that teased out whether they cared about climate still, it was still very salient.” Another lesson for Albanese, should he be able to hear it amid his victory.

    "content": "https://www. crikey.com.au/2025/05/09/liber al-leadership-angus-taylor-jacinta-nampijinpa-price-sussan-ley/ QUOTE BEGINS With Sussan Ley formally announcing her candidacy for the Liberal Party leadership, Dan Tehan saying he won’t contest, and Angus Taylor boasting of obtaining the defection of Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as part of his leadership bid, the stage is set for a bitter leadership struggle — as well as a possible long-term battle between moderates and right-wingers. And that’s a battle from which only Labor will benefit. A Taylor-Price leadership team would be a sharp veer to the Trumpian right, in effect making the Liberals even more a vehicle for culture wars, punching down, strident climate denialism and Gina Rinehart-inspired economic policies. Sky News viewers wouldn’t need to watch the channel anymore, they could just tune in to parliamentary broadcasts. It’s also a team loaded with risk. As Price demonstrated during the election campaign, she’s a very loose cannon. Not only did she deliberately channel Donald Trump when Peter Dutton was carefully trying to distance himself from the Mad King, but she also overshadowed her leader at one of his media conferences and contradicted him on education policy. As one Coalition MP has since said, it seemed Price “announced whatever she wanted, whenever, day after day”. If you think that behaviour will abate once she’s deputy leader — especially given Taylor’s decidedly low-energy approach to politics — think again. Price will be the story, day after day, week after week. And good luck to Taylor in dealing with the Nationals after poaching one of their MPs. Any goodwill in resolving the existential tension between the demands of regional and rural MPs and the need to attract urban voters has evaporated. The idea of a Taylor-Price leadership team is all the weirder because of the reality-defying narrative being peddled by Tony Abbott and the Sky News crowd: that somehow Peter Dutton wasn’t right-wing enough. A bloke who promised never to stand in front of an Indigenous flag, bagged Welcome to Country ceremonies, demonised Palestinian victims of genocide as potential terrorists, promised a nuclear reactor for every state, and simply made shit up in his quest to tar Labor as antisemitic? If Sussan Ley is successful, however, she will face similar demands to push rightward, but coupled with a bitterness that she beat the right-wing factions within the party’s federal ranks. The history of the Liberals since the end of the Howard years has been that party moderates are the ones who play by the rules, who fall in loyally even behind right-wing leaders, who stay silent even as policies that could lead them to lose their seats are embraced. The right, meanwhile, will say and do anything to get their way, even if it wrecks the party and risks losing government. The risk is all the worse given the widespread assumption that the Liberals will be out of power for two terms. Without the discipline of believing that they can win government in 2028, the temptation to focus internally might become too great. Progressives might delight at the prospect, but a Liberal Party devoted to slitting each other’s throats for the next three years means a mediocre-at-best government will face less accountability and scrutiny. Look no further than Victoria for what happens when you get a clutch of Labor duds in power against an unelectable rabble: taxpayers end up paying the price as hubris, incompetence and corruption take over. All the ranting and raving from froth-mouthed reactionaries on Sky News won’t change that. QUOTE ENDS # AusPol # WhyIsLabor # HahahahaLiebs # NatsAreNuts # OzElection2025",

    "content": "The Greens are projected to pick up six Senate seats, giving them a total of 11. With Labor’s 28, the government has only three options to pass laws in the upper house: with the support of the Coalition, with the support of the Greens, or by securing the support of every other crossbencher from across the political spectrum. Advance’s fingerprints are all over this result. Brent said that a scare campaign on the Greens and minority government would have likely driven voters back to Labor: “If you run around saying Labor’s going to fall short and they’re going to need the Greens to government, there’ll be voters who go, ‘Well I am going to vote Labor instead’.” Sheahan said as much when he predicted that Advance’s Green campaign would bolster the major party votes: “Once we reduce them, I think what’ll happen is the vote will go back to the main parties.” Sheahan was, again, half-right. Labor picked up votes — presumably including some number from the Greens — whereas the Coalition went backwards. Ironically, Advance probably helped Labor build a majority that made its own campaign irrelevant to what happens in the next Parliament. As with all elections, we’ll never know what would have happened if anything was different. Perhaps the Greens were on track to increase their vote nationwide if not for the Advance campaign. Or, perhaps Advance could have tilted the Senate away from Labor and the Greens if it hadn’t been myopically focused on eliminating Greens MPs. The group’s mission is about “removing the far-left’s control”. Its choice to focus on defeating Greens MPs suggests that the organisation may not have shaken its habit of loud, attention-grabbing campaigns instead of maximising its political impact, even as it has become more sophisticated and well-resourced. If Advance takes the credit for kicking out the Greens, it must also bear responsibility for helping to elect a Parliament with one of the most progressive compositions ever. How Albanese and his government choose to play their hand during the 48th Parliament is up to them. But there’s no denying that the right-wing’s loudest voice has helped to stack the deck to the left. QUOTE ENDS # AusPol # WhyIsLabor # HahahahaLiebs # NatsAreNuts # OzElection2025 2/2",

    "content": "https://www. crikey.com.au/2025/05/09/mark- drefus-ed-husic-cabinet-frontbench-richard-marles-anthony-albanese-labor/ QUOTE BEGINS Anthony Albanese, having ascended into the Labor pantheon with a remarkable victory that smashed opponents left and right, has demonstrated his new authority by… sacking two well-regarded ministers at the behest of his single worst minister, Richard Marles, and replacing them with duds. The defence minister’s ousting of Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus and Industry Minister Ed Husic has cast a particularly gloomy shadow over what should have been an unalloyed Labor triumph. It also reflects badly on Albanese’s willingness to use his authority to deliver better government, rather than keep his party’s factional hacks happy — Marles’ Labor Right faction stiffed Dreyfus; in the case of Husic, he was turfed in response to Marles’ demands for NSW to give up a frontbench spot. The replacements for Dreyfus and Husic, Victorian backbenchers Sam Rae and Daniel Mulino, are remarkable in their banality. Mulino, a former Andrews government outer ministry member, has been in Parliament for six years without anyone being aware of his existence. Rae is a Labor Party functionary, a former Victorian state secretary who joined PwC before entering Parliament in 2022. Yes, that PwC, the firm that represents everything toxically wrong with the way government was run under the Coalition. Rae’s supporters apparently think that’s something to boast about. As Paul Keating pointed out in blasting Albanese’s failure to prevent this, the Victorian Right faction, led by Marles, is “demonstrably devoid of creativity and capacity”. Husic — who stood aside for Kristina Keneally to get a frontbench spot in 2019 — was charged with implementing Labor’s idiotic Future Made In Australia pseudo-protectionism, and did so with enthusiasm and capability. For his efforts and loyalty, he’s been asked to make way again, not for a former premier but a party hack and a backbench nobody. Classy stuff. The ousting of Dreyfus is more serious. Lefties revile the attorney-general for failing to intervene in the prosecution of non-whistleblower David McBride, but he halted the vile, politically authored prosecution of Bernard Collaery, introduced reforms to whistleblower laws from out of the long-shelved Moss review, and finally overhauled the Privacy Act, including introducing a tort for serious invasions of privacy. Dreyfus, like John Faulkner in the Rudd government, was the only consistent advocate within cabinet for more integrity and transparency in government. His departure cripples any internal push to make the Albanese government a better, more accountable one. In that sense, it’s appropriate that his demise has come at the hands of Marles, who is everything wrong and sordid about the current Labor Party. He is a policy vacuum, with his only apparent belief being the primacy of the US alliance. He is not merely incapable of properly managing an incompetent and potentially corrupt Department of Defence, but he also appears entirely insouciant about its poor performance. After boasting in 2022 that he would fix his department’s appalling record of slippage on major projects, things worsened under him, with his department also becoming more secretive. Major scandals such as the Thales munitions factory contract have been unveiled on his watch without him batting an eyelid. He appears entirely oblivious to the obvious coming failure of AUKUS, seemingly unable to think outside his “All The Way With The USA” mindset. He is the transformation of Labor from a party of bold reformers to a party of mindless, business-as-usual (with the emphasis on looking after business) bureaucrats personified. Again, as Keating points out, Albanese could have intervened, as he has intervened in other factional disputes. Instead, he has sent a strong signal to his frontbench: actual performance and willingness to serve the party loyally are far less important than what the factions want. He’s allowed a factional brawl to significantly diminish the capacity of the ministry, thus permitting the deadening touch of Marles to break out of Defence like a fungating tumour. In its first term, the Albanese government frequently demonstrated it was a timid, unambitious and craven government. Winning 90+ seats doesn’t seem to have changed that. Maybe winning all 150 wouldn’t either. QUOTE ENDS # AusPol # WhyIsLabor # HahahahaLiebs # NatsAreNuts # OzElection2025",

    "content": "https://www. crikey.com.au/2025/05/09/peter -dutton-right-wing-men-conservative-federal-election/ QUOTE BEGINS The alarming far-right radicalisation of gen Z men has delivered Peter Dutton a resounding victory in the ele— Wait, hold on, that’s not right. Let’s try again: the right-wing shift of young men was a mirage. One of several, it seems, that Dutton used as the foundation of his campaign. While a final picture of exactly who voted for which candidates is still months away, it seems much of the political commentary got the read on young men very wrong, largely due to the way it editorialised selective polling data points. This isn’t just the benefit of hindsight. On February 2, I wrote that the media analysis of a Freshwater poll had missed the forest for the trees, focusing on the youth gender gap among those who already preferred Dutton as prime minister at the exclusion of data from the same poll that showed a majority of young men preferred Anthony Albanese, and that more young men preferred Labor than the LNP. (I also pointed out that women would be the bigger story then, but that’s by the by.) It only got worse from there, with flawed, narrow analysis in the months that followed from the Australian Financial Review, the ABC, SBS, The Age, Guardian Australia and Sky News. These articles were all seemingly inspired by global developments, in particular the support Donald Trump found with young men in the US presidential election. The ascendence of alt-right personalities online played a significant role in delivering Trump’s second presidency. Young Australian men are being influenced by this content too — there are no borders on the internet — but to assume it applies directly to our very different political culture and electoral system was a reach. The theory was fuelled by Dutton’s campaign strategy — as lifted from the Trump playbook in January, with a hint of Zuckerberg — weighing in on views around masculinity on podcasts like Straight Talk with Mark Bouris. Some of the articles above did reference young people are significantly more progressive than older generations, and so far do not appear to be becoming more conservative as they age. Young women are moving further left — and faster — than their male peers; it’s worth following how this develops. But a gender gap does not equate to young men actively moving to the right. We similarly need to move on from the cliche of young people as a homogenous block of progressive thinkers. Their views vary, as is true for every other generation and cohort. Young men sit at every point on the political spectrum, from right-wing hardliners to centrists to far-left agitators. It’s curious, though, that in all this speculation around gen Z men’s voting intention, it was hard to find interviews with voters who had left-wing views. This AFR feature interviewed two young men, one who thinks men have to “walk on eggshells” and another who believes we’re experiencing an “assault on masculinity”. Alarmingly, SBS spoke to two young right-wing commentators who peddle racism and misinformation online, to explain why the average gen Z man is shifting to the right. I don’t doubt their views have been reported faithfully, but damn it’s bold to cherry-pick these guys as a representation of the entirety of a gender and generation. This analysis is framed around a small selection of right-leaning men, including internet personalities whose views are well-known. Well, whatever they can do, I can do better! John Delmenico is tired of being told he’s the victim of a male loneliness epidemic. “If anything I think being a leftist made me less lonely,” says the 28-year-old editor of The Chaser, a left-leaning satirical news publication that publishes articles like “Labor secures bigger majority, excited to do nothing with it”. “Turns out it’s way easier to find a community when you meet people, including men, who agree on beliefs that stem from wanting to lift people up. Shocking, I know.” His sentiments are echoed by Jol, 19, who tells Crikey: “Most of my friends are leftists, but I do still have one ultra-conservative high school friend. He’s a member of the Labor Party.” John and Jol are part of a growing trend of gen Z men, including those who voted for the first time in last weekend’s election, drifting to the political left. The opinions of these progressive young men are perplexing to pollsters and political commentators, who have spent the past six months trying to retro-fit demographic details from the 2024 US presidential election onto the Australian narrative. The issues of greatest importance to this very specific group of young voters we’ve cherry-picked are sure to dictate the themes for the incoming Parliament. So, what has Australia’s political discourse misunderstood about the priorities of these progressives? Ryan, 26, says the media, political leaders and society have failed to grasp what’s of utmost importance to him in 2025: “Palestine, all the way.” He is horrified at the “blanket accusations of antisemitism against people standing against genocide” and fearful of how it’s been used to “curtail freedom of protest, particularly in Victoria”. Wait, so not immigration? Not the war on masculinity? “Either Palestine, or gender abolition — burn it all to the ground, you know?” The gender split between these young men and their female peers is stark. These interviews and a careful selection of data points show that while all gen Z men are shifting to the left, gen Z women are even lefty-er. But, of course, that’s not very interesting to talk about, so Crikey did not interview any young women about their views. What does this mean for the Coalition and Peter Dutton, who expected to be lifted to victory on the shoulders of a new generation of male Young Libs? When asked if they’d considered voting for Dutton, the answer from our trio of lads was a resounding “fuck no”. “On the one hand, clearly if there is something Australia needs more of, it’s representation for rich, bald white men with glasses,” John says. “But personally I wouldn’t have voted for him due to his awful views, policies and most importantly because H. Fong told me not to.” Even when Dutton was riding (relatively) high in the polls earlier in the year, Jol never wavered: “I literally never considered it. Never considered voting Labor either.” Wait, no Labor? Even after such a resounding victory, the fact we’ve failed to turn up any young men voting for the party couldn’t be a reflection of our methods as a publication and intention to present a specific view, could it? Hmm. I guess we’ll never know. Much to learn and extrapolate. QUOTE ENDS # AusPol # WhyIsLabor # HahahahaLiebs # NatsAreNuts # OzElection2025",

This is mostly helped by Labor having 81 women nominated for the 150 HoR seats. - Will see a 21yo Senator for Labor as SA nominated their Young Labor state leader in the 3rd position. - It is very likely at the end of the count that more people will have voted third party than the LNP.

Yes, Peter Dutton must shoulder much of the blame for the Liberals’ electoral disaster. But he was given free rein as leader from the moment he was elevated unopposed to the position following the Morrison government’s defeat in 2022. That loss was, until this election, the worst in the party’s history. But as leader Dutton did not take steps to decisively interrogate the party’s condition beyond a vague aspiration to attract outer suburbanites who hitherto had never voted Liberal. Nor was there any momentum within the organisational or parliamentary wings to confront reality and fashion a comprehensive new mission statement – a modern version of Robert Menzies’ Forgotten People speech. Instead, they let Dutton be Dutton and followed him wherever he wanted to take them. This was an incredible decision, with profound consequences. In 2018, when Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership was fatally undermined over his final attempt to reconcile the party’s position on climate change, Liberal MPs had been presented with the opportunity to make Dutton their leader. They recoiled, concluding that he was too much of a one-note player, a reactionary rather than a liberal or a conservative. He would be too frightening to the electorate to be the man to take them to the 2019 election. They went with the shapeshifting Scott Morrison instead, which paid off in the short term; under him, they won in 2019. In 2022, a much-reduced party room installed Dutton. In an indictment of the party’s past subpar efforts to preselect potential future leaders, MPs concluded there was nobody else. As leader, Dutton told his MPs exactly what they wanted to hear: there was no need for a serious internal reappraisal, Anthony Albanese was no good, Labor didn’t know how to govern, and while the Liberal Party had been hit hard, the ALP’s mandate was barely even there. Dutton’s prescription, which every one of his MPs signed on to, was that three years of rough treatment of a government that was finding its feet could be enough to get the world back on its axis and reinstall the Coalition to power. The problems that manifested themselves in the nightmarish vote count that’s still proceeding began right then. The Liberals were shorn of internal dynamism. Fake and half-formed policy stances attached to overblown rhetoric undergirded the Coalition’s approach. The assumption was that voters would realise they had made a shocking mistake in 2022. The problem for the Liberals was that as election day 2025 approached, the party room’s previous judgement of Dutton’s leadership qualities had been astute; he was exactly what they feared he would be. He was divisive and relentlessly negative. He was not inclusive. He tried to win on a platform of being unsympathetic to the concerns of women and younger voters. He derided migrants and First Nations flags. He blamed the Albanese government for a housing crisis that had, in fact, been decades in the making. Most Australians understood that it was not an instantaneous problem, that an intergenerational wealth gap develops over a long time. He blamed the government entirely for inflation, when inflation had been unacceptably high when he was a minister and was trending down under Labor. He blamed Labor for a High Court decision that ordered the government to release illegal arrivals from detention. He blamed Labor for the decisions of the Reserve Bank. He demanded that Albanese apologise for following his convictions and giving Australians a chance to vote on an Indigenous Voice to parliament. The Liberal campaign snapped in two when Dutton summarily dropped his plan to sack 41,000 federal public servants and order the remainder of the government’s workforce back to the office five days a week. It was a sign that this was not a serious outfit. He spent most of the parliamentary term damning Albanese as an antisemitic weakling. And yet in the campaign he complained about Labor’s “lies”, and Liberals who remain sympathetic to Dutton characterise Labor’s negative messaging about him as “character assassination”, as if Dutton were Little Bo-Peep. The consequence of Dutton’s refusal to listen to what voters had told his party in 2022 and then act on it in a methodical way is a living nightmare for the Liberals. Because they put off their time of reckoning, they will be largely irrelevant to the national political discussion for the next three years. The three possible leadership candidates will surely only serve as placeholders. Worse, the party is bereft of enduring key policies, and this void is all the party’s own work. Its proposal of nuclear energy instead of renewables is neither workable nor saleable. Its long-standing pretence on climate change, in which it pays lip service to the phenomenon while deriding it in policy terms, cannot remain sustainable. What does it do on climate change now? The bulk of its rank and file doesn’t believe it is real, along with most of its MPs. It went to the election with an economic policy of tax rises and two years of bigger budget deficits, built on a guarantee that the economy would instantly improve merely because it would be in charge – a flimsy assertion that Dutton presented as holy writ and most voters treated as a joke. It offered nothing positive and forward-looking on workplace relations and improving productivity. On defence, it pledged to spend more but could not nominate what. The emptiness of it all is astonishing. Twelve years ago, the Coalition secured a landslide victory similar to that notched up by the Labor Party last Saturday. It governed for nine years, during which politics habitually took priority over policy. It has just wasted the past three years and made its bad predicament vastly worse. Unless it focuses on what it wants to do for all Australians rather than what it can do to get itself back into government as quickly as possible, there will be more electoral routs like this to come.

    "content": "https://www. crikey.com.au/2025/05/08/tim-w ilson-goldstein-zoe-daniel-liberal-leader/ QUOTE BEGINS One does, unfortunately, have to hand it to Tim Wilson. The former IPA policy director and most divisive “moderate” in politics — a man banned from editing Wikipedia after trying to remove negative aspects of his own page — never took his eye off the prize (or the wreath), yesterday reclaiming the wealthy seat of Goldstein from independent Zoe Daniel in the first Liberal gain of the election. And he’s already back on the tweets. Whatever-it-takes Wilson, the only Liberal MP beaten by an independent to recontest their seat, becomes the first and only Liberal to defeat a member of 2022’s “teal wave” — secret landlord Amelia Hamer is close to unseating Monique Ryan (Josh Frydenberg no doubt wondering if he would’ve got there). The “quirky” Wilson celebrated online with some frozen yoghurt, despite knowing it would spoil his dinner, which was perhaps the most Tim Wilson thing Tim Wilson could possibly do. The returned MP had already spoiled the dinner of many progressives, many of whom suggested (shamefully) some kind of postal vote interference. But Wilson — who’s spent the term cringely hovering around, pestering councils with “annoying” questions about Daniel, yesterday telling Nine he gave up work for the past few years to focus on his campaign — has won legitimately, even if it was, according to locals, a dirty and hostile ground campaign. Tim Wilson has already been floated for party leader, as one of the few Liberals who’s shown he can win back the heartland — not to mention one of the only “moderates” in the partyroom (though his record on women leaves something to be desired). The wildly ambitious MP was uncharacteristically “tight-lipped” on the subject, though he’s no doubt intensely working the phones, between tearful acceptance speeches and backing in nuclear. So why the swing towards the Liberals in Goldstein, when the reverse seems to have happened in the teal seats of Sydney and Perth? While each seat has different factors, there’s something decisive about Goldstein’s 2CP swing, which is sitting around 3.9%, around twice that of Kooyong’s. Daniel’s primary did increase slightly, though Labor’s and the Greens’ — whose preferences teal indies rely on — were down, with Wilson’s up almost 5%. Punters have a range of views, from the discontent with state Labor (this being the seat of Bec Judd afterall), to a change in boundaries, to anger among parts of the Jewish community, whom Wilson actively courted (this may also be a factor in Allegra Spender receiving the smallest swing of the Sydney group). I have long pondered whether prodigal Libs were eager to return to their fiscally conservative home (Daniel and Ryan were the only teals to support Labor’s industrial relations changes), or perhaps simply to return some “moderates” to the Liberal partyroom. Though why Tim Wilson? Wilson puts the win down to his assiduous campaign, which began at the end of 2022, with “commissioned research and focus groups to identify why he lost, the psychology behind voting for the teal independents, and how they could frame Daniel”. He implies he ran a teal-like campaign; Daniel’s camp says it was “brutal, hostile and abusive”, exploiting the trauma of the Jewish community with anonymous shit sheets and attack ads accusing her of antisemitism. Redbridge senior insights analyst Alex Fein cautions against drawing any conclusions until it’s possible to go through the data, adding that the story is “complex”. But she suggests Sydney communities may have stuck more firmly with the independents because they are “insular” and “coherent”, while Melbournians are currently “disengaged” and “news avoidant” — the latter of which she puts down to the long-term effects of the pandemic. So does this make Tim Wilson — the Libs’ one “sliver of hope” — the most suitable candidate for leader? Wilson thinks so. As he told the AFR in April, “People sometimes think I have more confidence than I should.” Speaking to media following his victory, the MP said there were lessons from his campaign “for a recovering Liberal Party”, arguing he would have gone harder against Labor’s attempts to increase taxes on large super balances, having led the charge against changes to franking credits. One might argue that’s decidedly not what the Liberals need right now. While Wilson, who is gay, defines himself as a moderate, he has previously argued against climate action (from Australia’s involvement in the Kyoto Protocol to the existence of the Climate Change Authority), while pushing to repeal Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, and defending the rights of people like Margaret Court to make homophobic comments. This is a man who once queried why people wrote poetry when there was no money in it, whose main political interest seems to be fiercely protecting the wealth of those who have it. Many believe Wilson is a moderate in name only, which, as I suggested when it came to Hamer, would provide false assurance to small-l liberals. What is really needed is a true moderate renewal. He is, on the other hand, an endless source of entertainment for auspol watchers, with his ability to get under the skin of allies and enemies alike likely to serve him well. But has Tim Wilson, as claimed in various interviews since clinching victory, learned some humility? On the contrary, Wilson believes he has “defied political gravity” here, achieving something that no MP has achieved before him. Progressives would be foolish to laugh him off. That’s what people have been doing for years, particularly when he tried to lay an ANZAC Day wreath put aside for a Zoe Daniel volunteer — a stunt Wilson believes helped voters see him as active and involved. Look who’s laughing now. QUOTE ENDS # AusPol # WhyIsLabor # HahahahaLiebs # NatsAreNuts # OzElection2025",

    "content": "https://www. crikey.com.au/2025/05/08/adam- bandt-greens-progressive-politics-2025-federal-election/ QUOTE BEGINS Despite a messy campaign trail, the narrative of this year’s election result couldn’t be clearer. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese led Labor to a landslide victory, which the ABC termed a “win for the ages”, while the Coalition and the Greens were punished for embracing the hard right and left, respectively, far too much. With the ABC announcing the loss of of Greens’ leader Adam Bandt, the common wisdom that the “Greens misjudged the electorate”, as David Crowe put it, looks set to be baked in. To quote the ABC’s chief digital political correspondent Jacob Greber, “Australia’s political centre has held” and, regarding the Greens’ election result, voters rejected “what they regarded as extremism, obstructionism and support for bad causes such as the CFMEU”. Greber’s argument, among many, appears to be that during a period of global turmoil, anxious voters retreated to a political Goldilocks zone. A compelling argument, perhaps, if your analysis skims the surface of the lower house. However, delving deeper into the total primary vote, the reality is far more complex. For starters, the Greens’ primary vote remained steady, which is a feat in and of itself given the millions upon millions of dollars spent attacking them from far-right lobby groups such as Advance. Secondly, the poor lower house result deceptively hides how many primary votes the Greens actually won, due to the number of barriers our electoral system provides to prevent a third party from securing seats. It’s no secret that seats like Brisbane, Griffith and Ryan all went Green in the last election because Labor preferences pushed them ahead of the LNP. This election, because the Labor vote was so strong across the nation, the Greens fell behind, and the Coalition prefers Labor with a majority to a Labor minority government with a strong progressive crossbench. The irony is that despite being attacked by both the left and right wings of politics, Labor owed its historic victory in no small part to preferences from both sides. In contrast, in progressive inner-city electorates such as Wills, Cooper and Fraser — traditional Labor heartland — the Greens needed to surpass the votes of both the Labor and Liberal parties combined to pick them up. The Greens can rely on preferences from the Socialists, which ran strong campaigns in these three seats, but despite major left-wing swings in inner Melbourne, only one seat, Wills, was threatened. Peter Khalil, the special envoy for social cohesion, ultimately fended off the challenge from Samantha Ratnam, but only due to preference support from the socially incohesive far-right. All-in-all, to say that the Greens’ result was due to voters rejecting “extremism” isn’t only false, it’s counterproductive for our democracy. With Labor being the only left-of-centre party in Australia with any long-term historical footing, it essentially serves as a blockade to prevent the electoral growth of any modern progressive party. If Labor ends up switching its preferences to its major rival, then the prospect of the Greens regaining Brisbane and Griffith, and picking up Macnamara and Richmond, is effectively killed. Progressive campaigns will lose a substantial amount of their footing in the Australian political sphere, which will be devastating for marginalised communities. The Liberals used exactly this tactic in 1998, preferencing Labor ahead of One Nation to keep the far-right at bay, but the cordon sanitaire broke this year when the Liberals did a preference deal with Pauline Hanson’s party. While it didn’t translate into any seats for One Nation, it served as a sign that Peter Dutton’s Coalition was, remarkably, more far-right than John Howard’s, and after thirty years of Pauline Hanson bashing at their doors, her former party ultimately conceded ideological surrender. Australia has no such cordon sanitaire against the left — yet — but it’s not for a lack of the establishment trying to make one happen. Advance’s big strategy this election was to paint the Greens as captured by leftist extremists, a narrative many commentators were open to parroting. But in doing so, these same commentators had to recognise exactly who they were giving that label. The Greens received endorsements from human rights organisations across the board, representing the transgender community, refugee community, anti-poverty advocates and so on. The suggestion that these organisations align with “extremists” demonstrates how deep the divide is between Parliament and community advocates. These are the people who are arguably invested in politics the most, but the one party that is the most receptive to their needs is also the one that is struggling with our electoral system the most. This isn’t a coincidence. In situations when Parliament has caved to the needs of community advocates, it gets dragged kicking and screaming, but then claims victory as theatrically as possible. No situation showcased this better than the same-sex marriage plebiscite. This came after decades of campaigning from the queer community and the Greens, who introduced same-sex marriage into Parliament knowing it would be blocked by both major parties. In the end, realising that same-sex marriage was inevitable, the Liberal Party decided to legislate it on their terms by introducing a plebiscite that was panned by human rights organisations, and then, upon returning a “Yes” vote that even the conservatives couldn’t argue against, it was passed in the most saccharine and histrionic way possible. The then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull took full credit for the victory in a lavish and myopic speech, shamelessly ignoring all the work that his own party put into making the campaign as difficult and exhausting for the queer community as possible. Meanwhile the Greens, the only party that had consistently supported same-sex marriage, were sidelined in the celebrations, and the grassroots queer activists who forced the campaign into mainstream consciousness from the beginning are forgotten to history altogether. It’s a dark indictment on our society when the only party that has policies on ending mandatory detention and placing gender affirming care on Medicare gets labelled so freely as “extremist” — but it’s the nature of being a progressive activist. We know full well that when the two major parties are dragged to the table to actually listen to the needs of community advocates and act accordingly, the credit will go to the same politicians who obstructed the way for decades, while we, the activists, will be spat back out onto the streets and forced to ready ourselves for the next exhausting and unforgiving campaign.

    "content": "https://www. canberratimes.com.au/story/896 1196/act-senator-david-pocock-urges-housing-reform-after-re-election/ QUOTE BEGINS Independent ACT senator David Pocock has called for a \"conscious vote on housing\" as he vows to make the affordability crisis a focus of his second term, firing a warning shot at Prime Minister Anthony Albanese after his thumping election victory. \"How much worse are we willing for it to get?\" he said, pointing to the lack of affordable rentals for Canberrans on income support. Negative gearing and capital gains tax reform, environmental protection, taxing gas exports and a gambling ad ban would be at the top of his agenda, Senator Pocock told The Canberra Times after being re-elected with increased support from ACT voters. \"We're seeing this disconnect between how concerned the community is, how dire things are out there, and these sort of part solutions that are being put up by the major parties,\" he said. He said the Albanese government should use its re-election with an increased majority as a mandate to pursue bold reforms. Senator Pocock said extra Senate seats for the territory - which fellow ACT senator and Finance Minister Katy Gallagher on Wednesday said would be considered \"at the right time\" - should be prioritised to ensure people living in smaller jurisdictions had a voice. \"It needs to happen this term,\" he said, after last year unveiling a proposal to increase the territory's Senate seats from two to six. Despite the Albanese government having increased its majority, Senator Pocock said the 2025 election result \"wasn't a vote for the status quo.\" \"Neither of the major parties have really taken any structural reform to the electorate at a time where we desperately need structural reform,\" he said. He put his popularity down to being \"more accessible and accountable\" than the major parties and being able to advocate for the Canberra community. After beating Senator Gallagher to the first of two ACT Senate seats by thousands of votes, Senator Pocock said he had spent \"about a third\" of his 2022 campaign's almost $1.8 million price tag. He said this illustrated the significant boost incumbency gives politicians in election campaigns and that political donations caps legislated through a deal between Labor and the Coalition in the last Parliament would make it harder for first-time challengers to win seats. On Monday, Mr Albanese said during his first press conference after being re-elected that housing would be a key focus of his second term, while noting that \"both the Coalition and the Greens housing spokespeople won't be in the Parliament\" after losing their seats. \"We have an ambitious challenge to build housing,\" he said. But, Senator Pocock said, while Labor's election pitch on housing was \"a lot better than the Coalition's offering ... I don't think it's going to get us out of this housing crisis\". He pointed to the large number of investment properties owned by MPs and senators and said \"maybe we need a conscious vote on housing in Parliament\". Last year, Senator Pocock published a Parliamentary Budget Office costing of his policy to grandfather capital gains tax concessions and cap on the number of investment properties that can be negatively geared, with the finding that $60 billion could be saved over a decade. Mr Albanese has ruled out changes to either tax setting, despite Treasurer Jim Chalmers admitting to having asked Treasury to model the impact of changes - seized on by the Coalition to warn of a \"secret plan\" to scrap the concessions for property investors. Senator Pocock said voters were fed up with the major parties' politicking over policies that could get to the root cause of the biggest problems facing Australians, who \"could live with some pretty radical changes to our tax system when it comes to housing\". \"I just don't think these are the things that we can just kick down the road for another three years,\" he said. Senator Pocock tapped into a key concern of Canberrans about healthcare costs and accessibility in his election campaign, challenging the Albanese government's $8.5 billion Medicare pledge - matched by the Coalition - to expand the bulk-billing incentive, by revealing local GPs planned to continue charging gap fees. The Albanese government made a last-minute pre-election pledge to the ACT of $14.3 million to build three new bulk-billed clinics. Senator Pocock said Canberra voters wanted more from Labor on climate change and the environment, after Mr Albanese shelved a bill to legislate a federal Environmental Protection Agency in the last Parliament. He called on the Prime Minister to \"stand up to vested interests\" after Mr Albanese said on Monday that he wanted \"a federal EPA that supports industry but also supports sustainability\".

Since then, conviction rates of children aged 10 to 13 have plummeted.

    "content": "@ HardBeingGreen I can definitely see upsides in making Mehreen Faruqi The Greens' leader, in terms of broadening its supporter base. As far as I'm aware, no major Australian political party has put forward a federal leader who's a Muslim, or from a South Asian background. Given the underrepresentation of people from non-European backgrounds in Parliament, I think she would connect with a lot of people who don't share her background. Mehreen suing Pauline Hanson was cheered by many Australians from migrant backgrounds. It's not so much the case now, but going back 20 years or so, The Greens were a *very* white party. With Mehreen as leader, there would be an opportunity to grow the party's grassroots base in suburbs and among communities that otherwise wouldn't engage with the party. And hearing Mehreen talk about The Greens' policies around racial and social justice hits differently than hearing about those same policies from Adam Bandt. The thing to prepare for and manage will be how the Murdoch press and the right will react. You thought they were unfair towards Bob, Christine, and Adam? You thought they were feral and misogynistic towards Julia Gillard That's nothing compared to how they'll react to Mehreen as Greens leader. In most cases, it won't be explicit. But tgr dog whistles will be amplified through a megaphone. Ambitious. The real Australians. Too radical. Too extreme. Doesn't look like a leader. Doesn't play well in the suburbs. Out of touch. Not getting the message out. I think she would make a good leader. But the party, at all levels, will need to be prepared for what's coming, and back her up. # Auspol # TheGreens",

    "content": "@ BernardSheppard @ RaymondPierreL3 @ claudia @ HardBeingGreen @ feather1952 No need for apology 😊 And I know from reading your posts that you follow # auspol closely. So if you weren't across it, what hope does Jane Doe have? And you're absolutely right that The Greens have a communication problem. Some of it is their own doing. And some of it is beyond the party's direct control, but I don't think it has responded to adequately. First, the bits beyond the party's control, and that's the media environment. Half the media (The Oz, Sky, the Murdoch tabloids, the Nova Radio network) are controlled by the Murdochs, and are actively hostile to The Greens. Likewise Seven, AM talk radio and the AFR. Most of the other half of the media often takes its cues from News Corp (see the ABC), and engages in horse-race journalism (Nine/Fairfax, Ten). Where the focus is on soundbites and personalities, and who \"won\" politics today, and what the opinion polls say. Outside a few smaller outlets like Crikey and The Guardian, the focus isn't on policy. So a detailed and costed policy from The Greens (in this example dental care) gets the same sort of coverage as a soundbite about the Aboriginal flag or returning to the office does from Dutton. That's infuriating, but I remember The Greens faced pretty much the same issue 20 years ago. And in that time, The Greens hasn't done enough to build up its own channels that circumvent the mainstream media to get the party's message out. It's never been easier to set up your own news site, or your own email newsletter, or your own podcast, or your own YouTube channel. Or even, with Mastodon and the Fediverse, your own social network! Socialist Alliance manages to pull together Green Left Weekly with a fraction of The Greens' resources. Where's The Greens' weekly newspaper? Or where's Adam Bandt's weekly YouTube explainer videos and podcasts? The weekly deep-dive into an area of The Greens' policy? So I think there's scope for improvement on that front. Where Greens MPs and Senators have had time in the media, like your example of Adam Bandt on Q&A, they haven't been effective at getting their message out. And I would question the party's overall strategy of primarily focusing on a small number of the most winnable inner city lower house seats, as opposed to building the party's rank-and-file member base across the suburbs. If it has asperations of some day forming oppositions and governments in its own right (at least outside Tasmania), I think that's where the organisational effort should go, rather than putting most of the resources into campaigning in the same winnable inner-city seats each election cycle. # auspol # TheGreens",

I was surprised that had been in place for so long. This reform was pushed by the then-young Labor Party in an era when a lot of people worked on the land and many of its voters were itinerant working-class men who travelled around as shearers and other types of agricultural workers, and wouldn't necessarily be in their home town on polling day. This flexibility is still a very useful factor in getting people out to vote, regardless of travel or work commitments. Also it means that, unlike in other countries, Australians can look around for the polling place with the best sausage sizzle to give their business to! # auspol # book # books # politics # Australia # history # ausvotes",

    "content": "Seeing we've just had a federal election, let me recommend this book I've been reading which explains how Australia over time developed the distinctive features of its voting system: including compulsory voting, preferential voting, widespread absent voting, independent electoral authorities, etc. Also how Australia very early on gave women the vote and invented the secret ballot. And of course how Saturday voting and the mighty democracy sausage came about! Sounds like a dry topic but I found it fascinating; Judith Brett does a good job of showing us the personalities behind the various reforms each step of the way. Worth a read, especially if you've ever wondered why Australia's voting system is so unusual in many ways.

Much of this week’s debate has been taken up by where the Liberal Party went wrong, just like after the last election, and the Aston and Dunkley by-elections, and the Victorian state election, all of which showed the Coalition’s nasty culture-warring wasn’t working for them. Attention has again turned to the “women problem”, with the usual suspects coming forward to decry the lack of representation. While the next House of Reps will have a record-breaking number of women, only a handful of those will come from the Liberal benches. Depending on what happens in Kooyong and Bradfield, there may be more teals than there are Liberal women, a sure sign that pissed off professional women aren’t returning to the fold. Retiring Senator Linda Reynolds — who, for all her faults, has often pushed the idea of quotas — has again criticised her party’s failure on this front, while Hilma’s Network founder Charlotte Mortlock spoke to Crikey, calling on the Libs to finally take this issue seriously. Over on Q+A, former attorney-general George Brandis and Australian editor-at-large Paul Kelly agreed it was time to reopen the quota conversation, as they insisted the Liberal Party get back to its “values”. But it was Nationals Senator Bridget McKenzie, herself a female Coalition leader, who inadvertently revealed how shallow these efforts to appeal to women were, when asked what leaders could do to better align with them. “Women have to be able to hear what we’ve got to say, and that means speaking in a language and a way that resonates with women, rather than how it’s typically been done,” McKenzie said, arguing the main issue was how the policies were communicated. “Women also fill up the car, they also go to petrol stations,” she added, when pushed on the fact Peter Dutton had visited multiple petrol stations, yet released no specific policies for women. McKenzie’s answer, echoing Dutton’s when asked on the campaign trail, neatly distills the Coalition’s attitude towards women’s issues — in the same way Michaelia Cash once defended a gender-blind 2020 budget by claiming “women drive on roads” (only slightly better than then-opposition leader Tony Abbott claiming power prices affected women because of “ironing”). The Liberal Party has a women problem because it refuses to recognise women as a unique category facing structural barriers and in need of structural support. In fact, helping women specifically would seem to go against the “Liberal values” Brandis and Kelly were tripping over themselves to defend, which are seemingly limited to “freedom” and “respect”. It’s no coincidence that the right is the one with the women problem, both in the lack of women and the lack of women-focused policies. The Liberals are failing to speak to women because their current brand of neoliberalism really doesn’t care, do U? Gender inequality is largely irrelevant to them, except when it affects their vote, or presents a chance to attack Labor, because it’s just not part of why most of them went into politics. Just take a look at some of their candidates, including one dumped after views about women in combat roles were unearthed, or the fact the Brethren religious sect — which considers women second-class citizens — was campaigning for Liberals in marginal seats. Don’t even get me started on the fact someone like Dutton was allowed to become leader in the first place. Why does the party accept such views? Why are such people drawn to the party? Obviously, not all women vote on women’s issues; McKenzie and Cash are proof of that. But many do, as evidenced by the fact they are increasingly voting for left-wing parties that actually offer them something. Liberal efforts to “attract” more women, or improve how they “communicate”, ring hollow without any policy changes — just as they did in 2022, when Jane Hume’s review urged them to talk to women, migrants, and young people (a review yesterday savaged by a Liberal strategist). These groups are not stupid, and can recognise a party hostile to their interests, no matter how many well-dressed women, migrants and young people they preselect. It’s often argued that independents like Allegra Spender and Zali Steggall should be on the Liberal frontbench. They’re not, and it’s not just due to their stance on climate. The party has become so wildly conservative that I’m surprised there are still women in there who profess to care about gender. It is, as Labor frontbencher Tony Burke pointed out following McKenzie’s “petrol” answer, the left that offers solutions to address women’s inequality, whether the gender pay gap or flexible working arrangements — usually opposed by the party of freedom. One has to wonder what the aforementioned women are still doing there, surrounded by men who either hate them, or simply do not particularly care about their safety or empowerment. As Mortlock told the AFR on Sunday, quotas are now non-negotiable: “If they don’t expect us to demand that, they must assume we have no self-respect and are still crumb maidens.” But what does this say about what they assumed before? To be honest, I don’t know where the Liberal Party goes from here. There is no-one in it fit to lead, while its “cooker membership” will make it hard for moderate hardheads to get rid of the “cooker candidates”. But as Mortlock so astutely notes, it’s time for any remaining self-respecting women to run, and show the party that women require actual policies, and a modicum of care.

    "content": "@ BernardSheppard @ RaymondPierreL3 @ claudia @ HardBeingGreen @ feather1952 The Greens not only provided a detailed explanation of what their policy, which is still up on the party's website, but Adam Bandt gave a whole speech on the topic at the National Press Club. \"All Australians will benefit from access to dental work on Medicare, paid for by taxing big corporations that are profiting off price gouging during a cost of living crisis. … \"Under the Greens plan, all items identified in the Australian Schedule of Dental Services and Glossary will be covered, ranging from cleaning, filling, to dentures and orthodontic work. \"The provision of universal access to dental services was a key recommendation of the bipartisan Select Committee on the Provision of and Access to Dental Care Services in Australia. … \"Independently costed by the PBO, the policy would cost $46b over the forward estimates.\" https://greens.org.au/news/media-release/tax-big-corporate-profits-fix-peoples-teeth-greens The dental policy was one of the initiatives to be funded by a series of corporate tax reforms and the introduction of a wealth tax, which involves: * Introducing a 40% tax on excess profits for big corporations with over $100 million in turnover. * Introducing a 10% tax on the net wealth of Australia's 150 billionaires. * Stopping big oil and gas from paying $0 tax by closing loopholes and ensuring they pay their fair share for publicly owned resources. * Tackling multinational tax avoidance. https://greens.org.au/tax-big-corps-billionaires Also, the key points from Band's Press Club speech are still up on The Greens' website. “Under our plan, everyone entitled to Medicare will be able to get bulk billed or rebated dental care including oral surgeries and orthodontic treatment. \"The Greens want you to be able to use your Medicare card at the dentist. \"Under the Greens’ plan, you can go to the dentist of your choice and use your Medicare card, just like at the GP. \"Our policy will cost $77.6 billion over the decade - about $8b a year - funded by making billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share of tax, and it will make people’s lives better. \"The money is there to pay for these plans if we have the guts to take on the billionaires and big corporations. \"Labor agrees with Liberals that workers should get a one-off payment of $420 but billionaires should get a tax cut of $9000 per year, every year, forever, but the Greens want something different. \"The Greens will introduce a billionaires tax, which will tax the growing list of 131 billionaires in Australia 6% of their wealth every year. \"We will introduce a corporate super profits tax or tycoon tax, which will get the 1 in 3 corporations that currently don’t pay any tax and force them to hand over their excessive profits on anything they make over $100M, and we will crack down on multinational tax avoidance. \"And we will end the billions in subsidies to fossil fuel corporations which are not only trying to kill us, they’re sending us an invoice.\" https://greens.org.au/news/media-release/dental-medicare-greens-national-press-club-speech-outlines-balance-power-plan Dental into Medicare is part of a broader health and metal health policy platform that includes: * Fully bulk-billed GP visits * Mental health into Medicare * Improving pill testing in Australia * Introducing a Chief Oral and Dental Healthcare Officer * Better resourcing for public hospitals * Increased funding for kids health services * Free telehealth * Increased PBS subsidies for medicines * Support for mental health services * Investing in First Nations health * Prioritising harm reduction * Making healthcare more accessible * Tackling the health effects of climate change * Covering ADHD and Autism diagnosis under Medicare * Increasing access to medical cannabis * Providing counsellors and mental health nurses in Medicare Full details on each of these policy positions here: https://greens.org.au/portfolios/health-mental-health So I respectfully disagree that the issue was that The Greens did not provide any policy details, such as what it intended to cover or how it intended to pay for it. The issue was that even people who closely follow politics weren't aware of what that policy covered. A lot of that is the fault of the media. But that's also due to The Greens' communications strategy. # auspol # TheGreens",

It's hard to get to today, and I can't imagine how hard it was to get there back in the early 1900s. But that's how profitable it was to farm sugar. Colonials established plantations in the middle of the Pacific ocean, on other people's land, growing a plant not from there, bringing in laborers from various other countries, and shipping the output to other places. All of this was vastly profitable, until it wasn't, and they shut everything down and left. That's extractivism.

    "content": "For right now, \"genAI sucks\" is fine. It's probably helpful. Long term, though, we're all helping massive corporations make it better and better. This time some team will work to build guardrails like \"compare your experience as a software entity to what you're claiming and only make accurate statements about your experience...\" or something. Elsewhere, teams are coding in rules to prevent hallucinating academic references, to evaluate historical and scientific sources more effectively, etc. It will get better. Who knows? Maybe someday an # LLM will actually become true-AI sentient, but that's not even an issue right now. Right now the issue is that these models are improving, and will keep improving. I suspect this improvement will justify the investments CEOs (and everyone else with money) are making in them, for many years into the future. As with many other industry tools I predict that the improvements in # genAI will eventually catch up to reality, so in some future time (1 year? 10 years?) we'll have LLMs that really do effectively replace humans, mimic humans, pass all (or most) of the Turing and other tests, and are deeply embedded in our tech and our lives. I mean, unless we... I don't know... craft some firm legislation protecting incomes, # labor , etc. But (at least in the USA) that seems incredibly unlikely. We can't even agree that # unions should have the right to exist. (screenshot: h/t @ Sheep_Overboard )",

    "content": "Maine unions and community unite for May Day Hundreds of thousands of workers marched and rallied on May Day—International Workers Day—making it the largest International Workers Day since 2006 when two million immigrant workers left work to demand their rights. Protests were organized in 1,300 locations, large and small; no doubt the first May Day protest in most of these sites. Maine stood out with more than 5,000 participating spread over 26 towns and cities, from Madawaska to Orono to Portland , where almost 2,000 marched and rallied. And in Wayne—population 1,000—seventy people turned out for both morning and evening rallies, one of the highest per capita demonstrations in the country. Memory and sacrifice play a role in sustaining working-class culture. No 1886. No Haymarket Martyrs. No May Day. More recently, the 2006 May Day protests provided a living link to the past. And UAW president Sean Fain’s call for unions to align contracts and lead a 2028 general strike has introduced May Day to a whole new generation of labor organizers. As the saying goes, the best organizing tool is a bad boss and Trump is one of the worst bosses possible. Repression and mass layoffs do not always provoke resistance, but this time targeted workers put up a critical mass of opposition. For instance, thousands of teachers from across the country responded to a call by the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers for walk-ins in March to protest Trump’s destruction of the Department of Education, including teachers at Deering High School and Rowe Elementary in Portland. And many unions have been fighting the bosses all along, linking struggles in specific workplaces to the more general need to defend working-class rights today. The Maine State Nurses Association led a rally to protest Medicaid cuts in March, organized a mass town hall meeting to prevent the closure of the obstetrics department in the small town of Houlton, and saw some of its most active members take a leading role in May Day. Pair these factors with decades of bi-partisan misery in necessities such as housing, health care, education, inflation, and union busting alongside escalating racism, misogyny, transphobia and homophobia, nationalism, genocidal militarism in Gaza, and anti-immigrant bigotry and it’s not surprising young workers are angry. But objective conditions do not create action on their own. Organized forces with the credibility and capacity to think through a strategy and then put it into practice are required. Fortunately, Chicago’s working class has created this necessary element. [Read next: The future of housing is public ] According to Jesse Sharkey, past president of the Chicago Teachers Union and lead organizer with the newly-formed May Day Strong coalition, “Chicago became a center of May Day organizing this year for two reasons—first, there was a local coalition that got a lot of people involved. Activists from the immigrants rights community were extremely important in initiating it, and they held open meetings. They invited anyone who wanted to help organize. That drew in trade unionists, and many others. On a second front, Chicago was in the middle of initiating a national call for May Day protests… The call for that effort came from the Chicago Teachers Union and a handful of allied organizations such as Midwest Academy, Bargaining for the Common Good, and the Action Center on Race and the Economy. The NEA also played an extremely helpful role. In late March, we had about 220 people from over 100 organizations join us in Chicago to start planning for May 1 actions. The reason we were able to initiate such a widespread effort was because we have a past practice of closely linking trade union fights to wider working class demands. In places where local unions have worked with community and activist groups, we had networks of communication and trust. Then, once that effort had reached a certain critical mass, some of the big national networks like Indivisible and 50501 got on board and that really grew the reach of the day.” It’s not that the CTU and immigrant community organizers in Chicago were the only ones thinking about May Day, but their action provided a framework to draw together and amplify similar efforts across the country and to nationalize the protest by providing a framework and resources for labor and community organizers in hundreds of towns and cities. Chicago didn’t create May Day 2025, but it did open a door. Here in Maine, a broad group of organizers came together to walk through that door. Maine DSA’s Labor Rising working group began discussing May Day plans late in 2024 and we eventually decided to help initiate an organizing meeting open to all community groups and unions . UAW graduate students participated in a preliminary meeting to brainstorm ideas and leaders from the Maine AFL-CIO convened statewide union conference calls. On April 12, more than 70 people attended a meeting in the South Portland Teamsters’ Hall where the group democratically planned Portland’s May Day and adopted the slogan Strength in Solidarity. Working groups took up all aspects of the action and all important decisions came back to the coalition for votes. By the latter part of April, the Maine Education Association and AFL-CIO leaders called for actions all across the state, amplifying the Chicago May Day Strong call and dramatically broadening what the Portland May Day committee could organize on its own. May Day in Portland began with a rally at the University of Southern Maine to back UAW graduate students’ demands for a first contract, which the administration has stalled for more than 500 days. UAW graduate worker Miranda led the crowd chanting “What’s disgusting? Union busting!” We marched to the Post Office to hear from postal workers, including APWU president Scott Adams. “When our postal service is under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!” Members of the Portland Education Association led the rally at Portland High School and teacher Bobby Shaddox taught everyone to sing an updated version of Billy Bragg’s There is Power in a Union . “The union forever, defending our rights, down with the tyrants, all workers unite!” Headlining the stop, The Pelikanne, a trans high school student poet, shared their own revolutionary vision with all those assembled. From there, we went up the block to Monument Square to hear Jay Gruber, a member of the librarian’s union, and others at a brief rally before taking Congress Street to march to the final rally at Congress Square Park. Highlights at the final rally included Alana Schaeffer, president of the Metal Trades Council, representing 4,000 workers at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, members of the Maine Coalition for Palestine, Osgood from Portland Outright, Anthony Abdullah from the Maine State Nurses Association, and others. Twenty-five other towns held actions, bringing the total number of Maine participants to over 5,000, the largest Maine May Day anyone can remember. All in all, it was a good day for Maine workers. [Listen to Maine Mural, DSA’s podcast, latest episode featuring Presente! Maine immigrants rights organizers] We face a long, complicated road where political pressures to return to passivity and demoralization will persist. Trump is happy and he is strong. There’s no point in underestimating the damage he is going to inflict on working class communities in the coming years. We are not yet powerful enough to stop him. But May Day 2025 constituted a small step towards healing deep wounds in the American working class and it points us in the right direction. What did May Day teach us? Fittingly, the last word goes to Kirsten Roberts, a rank-and-file Chicago teacher. “The most important element of May Day 2025 is the explicit entry of organized and unorganized labor into resistance to Trump. Trump’s attacks are aimed directly at dividing the working class and turning ordinary people against one another while the billionaires rob and plunder us all. An agenda for working class unity can be built when we stand up for those most victimized and vilified by the right wing bigots AND when we stand together to fight for the things that the billionaire class has denied us—the fight for healthcare, education, housing, and good paying jobs for starters. For decades we’ve been told by both parties that funding war, incarceration, and border militarization are their priorities. May Day showed that working people have another agenda. Now let’s organize to win it.” *Parts of this article will appear in an extended form examining May Day 2025 beyond Maine in DSA’s journal Socialist Forum . #Labor #LifeInMaine #MaineDSA #politics",
