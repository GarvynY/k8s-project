Before the election, @ taniel of @ bolts talked to politics professor Judith Brett about the country‚Äôs compulsory voting law ‚Äî its history, how it‚Äôs evolved, and whether it leads to better engagement as well as turnout. ‚ÄúLook, the fines that one pays are pretty minimal; you get a letter, and you‚Äôve got to give a reason why you didn‚Äôt vote,‚Äù says Brett. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the fine is the reason people vote.

It‚Äôs the political culture around voting ‚Ä¶ What we know from research is, if you don‚Äôt have compulsory voting, the people least likely to vote are poorer people, and people from new migrant groups, and often the young.

Little, though, has been made of an equivalent crisis of the left, if that word still serves to name those forces that define their role as progressive. Both share the new, yet unspoken, reality of Australian politics: that the ALP is no longer a party of the centre left but the new party of the centre right. However competent and formidable it might be, the party cannot disguise its move away from its more radical past by simply waving a Medicare card at every photo opportunity. Nature abhors a vacuum: as the Liberals mounted a Jack Russell race to the MAGA right, Labor moved into the high country they vacated. Labor abandoned any pretence of being a party of the environment, as it was in the ‚Äô70s, ‚Äò80s and ‚Äô90s, and, if it still cosplays as being a party of social justice, its reforms are timid and piecemeal. Yet even if its leader seems to like arriving at a barbecue in a billionaire‚Äôs helicopter and its policies are deferential to corporate Australia, being centre right is, as the election confirmed, infinitely preferable for many more Australians than the dark MAGA fantasies of the Liberal Party, the same fantasies that are wreaking such destruction in the US and globally. But not being MAGA does not make Labor a party of progress. If Labor has ambitions, they are not of changing society but of preserving its own power into a third term by consolidating itself into the status quo of an increasingly unequal 21st century society as the new party of corporate Australia. Notwithstanding the MAGA lamentations of Gina Rinehart, as Elizabeth Knight, this masthead‚Äôs business columnist, noted: ‚ÄúThat whoosh you heard on Sunday, as Labor did its victory lap, was a collective exhale of relief from the big end of town‚Äù. Knight goes on to report that as Westpac chief executive Anthony Miller ‚Äúsees it, Australia has jumped to the top of the league tables as an attractive place for international business to invest and international talent to make a new home‚Äù. Labor‚Äôs victory is a paradox: Hawke won in 1983 with half the primary vote (49.5 per cent), while Albanese won last Saturday with just over a third (34.75 per cent) ‚Äì a proportion that would have been seen as catastrophic 20 years ago. Labor‚Äôs great victory came not from the drying dam of its primary vote but the rivers of preferences flooding in from independent and Greens voters. In the opposite of a Reservoir D0gs Mexican stand-off where everyone points a pistol at everyone else and almost all die, the preferential system sees avowed enemies electing each other. Thus, Labor and the Liberals collude in preference deals where they are challenged by independents or Greens, yet Labor‚Äôs successes against the Liberals are bound up in getting Greens and independent preferences. Without them, the Liberal Party‚Äôs problems today could well be Labor‚Äôs in the not-so-distant future. Meanwhile, out on the now eerily emptied savannah of the left, the same paradox haunts what remains: fewer independents and Greens. And yet, the national vote for independents keeps going up and the federal Greens vote remains close to its peak. While the Greens harbour a romance of an alliance with Labor, that is ever less likely as Labor shifts further right and delights in its utter contempt for them. The Greens, though, like a spurned lover, keep seeking to be embraced by the ALP once more. As well as preferencing Labor in almost all electorates, the Greens went into the election sounding not like an environmental party but the unloved left of Labor ‚Äì the same party that election after election uses the Greens for preference harvesting and then rejects its advances. Green-shaming is Labor‚Äôs political equivalent of slut-shaming. The only way out of this vicious dilemma that sees the two main parties continuing to decline as a popular force but dominate as an electoral force would seem to be some new alliance that seeks to create a closer working relationship between independents and Greens. With this kind of agreement, they would preference each other at elections rather than Labor, and work more closely together in parliament on the matters on which they are agreed. None of this would be easy: while voters have liked the crossbench co-operating on issues such as gambling reform and an integrity commission, they are less happy when they think an independent is electorally aligned with others. Despite the unremitting propaganda wheeled out through the election, independents are not Greens, and on many issues are far from the Greens‚Äô positions, while the Greens in turn find some independents‚Äô positions anathema. The problem for all is that the left is becoming an increasingly Balkanised landscape. The possibility of a new national ecology party forming to pursue the goals the Greens have abandoned only worsens the picture. Unless some way of coming together can be found, the alternative will be the spectre of the left‚Äôs growing irrelevance. In an Australia where the vote for non-major parties is the size of the vote for Labor ‚Äì and growing ‚Äì the crossbench could begin reimagining its ranks as the place out of which governments of the future can be built. If independents could re-conceive their roles not just as individual representatives but as future national leaders, finding within themselves the ambition to ultimately aspire to create a government of allies, they may escape being condemned to the sidelines of history and show the larger, as yet unrealised, possibilities of Australian democracy. In some ways, the plight of the left today mirrors the crisis in which crushed conservatives found themselves in the 1940s when Robert Menzies united 18 anti-Labor groups into a new, single force of conservatism that would become the most electorally successful federal political party in Australia‚Äôs history: the Liberals. Whether there is a comparable figure or figures on the left today who might bring together these disparate but important voices into some form of partnership or alliance that can hold Labor to account is a question only time can answer. But it is the question that must now be asked. Richard Flanagan won the 2014 Man Booker Prize for his novel The Narrow Road to the Deep North. In 2024, he won the Baillie Gifford Prize (for non-fiction) for his most recent book, Question 7. He is the first writer to win both prizes.

    "content": "https://www. smh.com.au/politics/federal/th e-liberals-must-make-peace-with-the-f-word-20250509-p5lxz9.html QUOTE BEGINS There is no greater confirmation of the Liberal Party‚Äôs inability to learn from its mistakes than a re-read of its 2022 election review. Such reviews are a convention on both sides of politics, and they (should) serve a sound purpose: the prosaic and simple purpose of learning history so as not to repeat it. The 2022 review, undertaken by former party director Brian Loughnane and Senator Jane Hume, contains many paragraphs that could be cut and pasted into the next review, covering the devastating loss the Liberals have just suffered. ‚ÄúThe party has lost nearly all of its inner metropolitan seats,‚Äù reads one 2022 observation. ‚ÄúOf particular concern in the results is that in seats with high numbers of female professional voters, the Liberal Party only holds three of the top 30 seats where previously it held 15.‚Äù Then there is the conclusion that ‚Äúthe only demographic class where the Liberal Party and the National Party have a stronghold is in rural electorates‚Äù. And its blunt follow-up: ‚ÄúNo party that is seeking to form government has a pathway to a majority solely through rural and regional electorates.‚Äù Further: ‚ÄúLiberal Party performed particularly poorly with female voters, continuing a trend that has been present since the election of 1996.‚Äù This is a kind way of saying that its share of the female vote has been falling for nearly two decades, with no serious attempts to arrest the decline. No acknowledgment, outside this review, that the lady-vote is not a boutique item, not an interest group or a minority to be pandered to, but instead, that it represents the numerical majority of voters. Also from the 2022 review: ‚ÄúA significant number of submissions to the review cited the Liberal Party‚Äôs declining vote among women as a decisive factor in the 2022 election loss. It is clear from the party‚Äôs research and post-election analysis that the party‚Äôs standing with women was an important factor in the party‚Äôs defeat.‚Äù Add the statement: ‚ÄúLiberal defectors in ‚ÄòTeal seats‚Äô were highly likely to agree with the statement that ‚Äòthe treatment or attitude toward women within the Liberal Party had a strong influence on my vote‚Äô.‚Äù Or: ‚ÄúImmediately following the election, a clear majority of Australians (across different electorates) agreed with the statement that ‚Äòthe Liberal Party has fallen behind the views of middle Australia‚Äô.‚Äù There are sections on the swing against the Liberals among Chinese-Australian voters, and a warning that the Liberals‚Äô policy agenda ‚Äúappeared to be limited and unclear to the electorate‚Äù. There is a call for the proper vetting of candidates, and the preselection of candidates in good time to prepare for the election campaign. And then the most damning conclusion of all. ‚ÄúMany of the matters raised in this review were also discussed in the reviews of the 2016 and 2019 federal elections,‚Äù the authors write. ‚ÄúMany of the problems identified have been constants for a decade or more.‚Äù What now? At the time of writing, Deputy Liberal Leader Sussan Ley had declared her candidacy for the leadership. On Friday, she told the Sunrise program, ‚ÄúWe did let the women of Australia down‚Äù. She continued: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm determined and convinced that I am the right person to lead the party forward at this time and I think my appointment would send a strong signal to the women of Australia, but it‚Äôs about much more than that.‚Äù Even in this brief statement, you can read the internal conflict of the Liberals: We know we have done a bad job with women, and we know we need to promote them to positions of leadership. But we can‚Äôt allow the impression to settle that they are promoted to positions of leadership because they are women. The conservative side of politics, in Australia and abroad, has always had difficulty embracing the values of feminism. In its furthermost right quarters, women are valued chiefly for their roles as homemakers and mothers, with a reluctant concession that some women have something to offer the public sphere. Former prime minister Tony Abbott eventually put out a replacement-wage maternity leave policy with the explanation that women should not be educated to a high level, only to be denied a career. ‚ÄúIf we want women of that calibre to have families, and we should, well we have to give them a fair dinkum chance to do so. That is what this scheme of paid parental leave is all about,‚Äù he said in 2013. In 2014, then-minister for foreign affairs Julie Bishop rejected the label ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù for herself. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt find the need to self-describe in that way,‚Äù she told the National Press Club. Feminist, she said, ‚Äúis not a term that I find particularly useful these days‚Äù. She said she would never ‚Äúblame the fact that I‚Äôm a woman‚Äù if something didn‚Äôt work out in her career. And yet, it is difficult to conjure any reason other than her gender to explain why Bishop was never treated seriously as a leadership contender by her own (majority male) colleagues. The Labor Party has achieved gender parity in parliament (if not in high leadership positions) through the effective implementation of quotas. The right side of politics has an anathema for the Q word, even though Liberals have, for years now, tentatively used the more gentle word ‚Äútargets‚Äù to assert they are onto the problem of the gross under-representation of women in their ranks. The Liberals should be the party of aspiration, and the party of peak economic productivity. Quotas are productive ‚Äì in the sense that they work, and they work quickly. Feminism is a byword for female aspiration ‚Äì the aspiration for what countless politicians like to call the Australian principle of the ‚Äúfair go‚Äù. Why is that F-word so ubiquitous, while the other one is so difficult for Liberals to utter? QUOTE ENDS # AusPol # WhyIsLabor # HahahahaLiebs # NatsAreNuts # OzElection2025",

    "content": "Along with being both a federal and state Labor MP, Dr Race Mathews was a passionate advocate for the idea that in a just society, businesses should be owned by their workers or customers through credit unions and co-operative societies: https://bccm.coop/vale-the-hon-dr-race-mathews/ # auspol # vicpol # cooperatives # capitalism # socialism # business \"Dr Race Mathews was a former Victorian and federal politician, a labour historian and an Australian co-operative economist. Dr Mathews was born in Hawthorn, Victoria in 1935. His first job was as a clerk for the Shell Oil Company, before going on to work as a primary school teacher, and a speech therapist. A long career in politics and academia followed. Dr Mathews held numerous positions in the Australian Labor Party and the co-operative and credit union movements and wrote extensively on their history, attributes and accomplishments. \"Dr Mathews joined the ALP in 1956 and served as chief of staff to Gough Whitlam and Labor leaders in the Victorian Parliament before he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1972. From 1972 to 1975, Dr Mathews was the Federal Member for Casey in the Whitlam Government, where he served as chairman of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties and chairman of the Government Members‚Äô Committee on Urban and Regional Development. \"From 1979 to 1992, Dr Mathews served in the Victorian Legislative Assembly as the Member for Oakleigh. During the Premiership of John Cain, he served as chairman of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Co-operatives, and held a number of portfolios including Minister for Community Services, Minister for Police and Emergency Services and Minister for the Arts. \"In his academic career, Dr Mathews held positions at Government and Business Schools at the universities of Monash, Deakin and Kent State in the United States. A major focus for his research was the complex of worker-owned co-operatives of the Mondragon Corporation in the Basque region of Spain and its origins in the social teachings of the Catholic Church. Mondragon was extensively referenced in his book Of Labour and Liberty: Distributism in Victoria 1891-1966 and was the core focus of his previous work, Jobs of Our Own: Building a Stake-Holder Society. \"Referring to Mondragon, Dr Mathews stated: \"'All my life I‚Äôve been on the hunt for good ways of making a better world ‚Äì making life more rewarding for ordinary people ‚Ä¶ [I was delighted to hear in the 1980s that] something extraordinary was going on in an obscure valley in the Basque region of Spain.' Dr Mathews also wrote important works on credit unions including: * Credit Unions and the New Mutualism, * Where Credit Is Due, * Reinvigorating Credit Union Mutuality, and * A Future or No Future: Credit Unions in a Globalising Economy. Dr Mathews was a significant contributor to numerous topics including Mutualism, Distributism, Labour Movement History and Public Policy. These books include: * Building the Society of Equals: Worker Co-operatives and the A.L.P. and * Turning the Tide: Towards a Mutualist Philosophy and Politics for Labor and the Left. \"Dr Mathews mentored many emerging co-operative leaders over the years. Away from the limelight, Dr Mathews quietly responded to many invitations to inspire grass-roots groups and their members struggling to make a better life for themselves through the promise of co-operation.\"",

In places like Melbourne and Wills, we have to outpoll both major parties combined. That‚Äôs always been a huge ask. Remarkably, we‚Äôve done it before, not just in Federal Melbourne but also in state seats like Melbourne, Richmond, Brunswick, and Newtown. But it‚Äôs no small task. \"In order to be successful, MPs need to build broad coalitions in their electorates to appeal to 50% of voters across different generations, cultures, and backgrounds. Labor MPs often do this by standing for as little as possible, and some commentators will now tell us that we need to do the same. But Adam [Bandt] showed us a different way. He built those coalitions without compromising our values. \"His team paired smart and genuine grassroots ground work with values-based work in Canberra and the media. Adam stood up for young people and renters, and for our poor and multicultural communities in public housing, while also building trust with older voters who care about the future, the environment and their local neighbourhood. It wasn‚Äôt either or. \"Political pundits right now are full of advice about how the Greens should change our ways to appeal to this broad coalition ‚Äî that we should talk less about Gaza, renters, or coal. Curiously, these are often the same people who used to tell us to talk more about the economy and less about climate change! \"What they don‚Äôt understand is something fundamental to who we are as Greens: unlike the major parties we‚Äôre not here to win for winning‚Äôs sake.\"",

He may not be Australia's most seductive rhetorician, but Anthony Albanese is the nation's pre-eminent politician. Soon to mark three decades in Canberra, Labor's unfashionable parliamentary stayer proved he is a tungsten tough leader who focused laser-like on the median voter and managed variables with more foresight than any politician since John Howard. His chief irritants on right and left were defeated so thoroughly that each was banished from the Parliament, their parties routed and decapitated. Key among his distinguishing attributes, argues my colleague, Dr Marija Taflaga, is an uncommon capacity for \"strategic waiting\". A second thought is this. After smashing a 21-year run of Australian PMs not making it to a second term, Albanese nudges hero status within Australia's oldest party in one of the world's oldest democracies. Not too shabby for a political figure derided by progressives as a tinkerer and by the right as not up to the demands of national security. Third. The Liberals' delusion of a new suburban backlash was years in the making. After their worst defeat in 2022, the party commissioned a review, read its recommendations on things like women and getting policy out in time, and then studiously ignored the lot. Indeed, Peter Dutton flagged what would prove to be his epic vote-shedding strategy in his first bullish statement as leader. Nobody in the Liberal or Nationals party rooms said boo. Fourth. The very existence of the Liberal Party cannot be assumed. Don't be fooled by the exaggerated protestations of those within its remnant parliamentary ranks who insist they will bounce back. Of course they must say this. But political parties have come and gone before. It was only when R G Menzies created the Liberal Party as an amalgam of non-Labor interests in the 1940s that what we regard as permanent came to be. The Liberal-Nationals Coalition has held office for 52 of the 81 years since its formation. It was, as Christopher Pyne liked to skite, \"a vote-winning machine\". That era is going the way of baby boomers who now constitute the party's shrinking conservative base. Fifth. Personnel matters. Leadership matters. The 2022 loss of the saleable liberal, Josh Frydenberg, licensed the ideological careen under Dutton that would render the Liberals irrelevant to most urban voters in this election and the next. Recognising this is the threshold challenge for rescuing the party's pragmatic-conservative value proposition to voters. Talk is not sufficient. It now needs to visibly demonstrate change by walking the walk. Sussan Ley is the logical choice right now. She proposes to \"meet the Australian people where they are\". This is the only sensible message to agree on internally if there is to be any hope of credibly communicating it externally. Opting for the right-wing fantasy ticket of Angus Taylor and Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa-Price (the darling of Sky \"after dark\") would transmit the insane assessment that, in fact, Dutton had not been hard-line enough. Sixth. Dutton was at war with the media. This was revealing. While relentlessly branding Albanese weak, it was Dutton who dogged the standard rigours required of high office. If he truly coveted the nation's top job, he would have buried his animosity, deep-sixed his rancorous \"hate media\" gibes, and fronted up to frequent Parliament House press conferences and interviews. The tougher the better. And he would have appeared at the National Press Club in the final week of the campaign per the Australian election tradition. The PM did. It was combative, but effective. Seventh. Albanese read Dutton's media cowardice like a book, granting the Liberal leader no less than four televised election debates. Two is common, four is unprecedented. This reflected Albanese's confidence that Dutton was underdone on policy, not match-fit for testing public interchanges, and that Dutton's abundant aggression would be his undoing with ordinary voters. All proved correct. Eight. The flagrant campaign for the Coalition, hammered nightly by Sky News, materially distorted its offering. Its foaming zealotry might have provided Dutton with a happy place for softball interviews, but these foghorns coaxed the Coalition into a resentful anti-woke cul-de-sac rent with scoffing cynicism and partisan \"common sense\". The various ways in which this febrile barracking separated the Coalition from ordinary Australian voters are legion, but prominent examples include its absurd government-funded nuclear policy, its belatedly dumped work-from-home ban, a proposed referendum to give ministers deportation powers over migrants, and a nasty populist plan not to create unemployment in Canberra rather than jobs. Nine. The Greens party's always grandiose claims to be an emerging force in the House of Representatives are over. For good. Their demise proved what was already known - that holding together a broad electoral constituency - rather than just a highly motivated section of it - requires nuance and compromise. A party of indignant protest cannot be both broad-based and narrowly pure. Tenth. Moderate NSW Liberal senator Maria Kovacic is correct - nuclear is a dead duck and always was. The new Liberal leader should immediately declare the climate wars over. They lost. Sovereign risk for renewables investment would evaporate were there a Coalition commitment to work with Labor on the energy transition. Oh, the warning? Big electoral shifts connote future volatility. Just like early voting, if you've done it once ...

We all benefit when a change of government is possible other than via internal machinations of a party.

Which is mostly about making the three-way splits in vote easier to visualise and thus easier to explain. I like it for that reason. # AusPol # GraphGeeks",

I think the move towards a strong \"other\" vote is a good thing, both for local representation, as well as national democracy.

Landslide victory will happen as a quirk of the preferences.

Hamas should release all the hostages and disband immediately, and Israel should withdraw and relinquish all plans to annex Gaza. . But neither will happen, the genocide will continue. The civilians will pay the cost. And Hamas will grow stronger, both inside Gaza and outside. . The more Palestinians Israel kills, the more Hamas martyrs they create. It's a never ending story, and the only winners are the arseholes behind the scenes pulling the strings. . And a lot of those arseholes are pulling strings inside the Trump administration... and, I suspect, the Australian government. . International relations are a complex mixture of smoke, mirrors, diplomacy, deception, threat and brute force. . And we, Australia, have thrown our lot in with the USA and UK. A historic alliance. And our little AUKUS cabal is pro-zionist. So Australia is forced to be pro-zionist. But a large chunk of everyday Australia is appalled at what is happening. We want peace. . Neville Chamberlain wanted peace, so he refused to confront the Nazis. We all saw how that ended. . I think we as a nation are reaching a point where we will have to make a decision. . Do we support Israel, support AUKUS or do we do what is right ? . It might be cold on our own, but it might be worth it...",

    "content": "The Coalition and the real hate media https://www. thesaturdaypaper.com.au/commen t/topic/2025/05/09/the-coalition-and-the-real-hate-media QUOTE BEGINS As editor of the British tabloid rag The Sun in the 1980s, Kelvin MacKenzie had a favourite description of how to make the lives of public figures unpleasant ‚Äì his journalists were instructed to ‚Äústick a ferret up their trousers‚Äù. It‚Äôs a matter of legend that whenever an editorial line proved unpopular (never mind wrong) MacKenzie would burst from his office, shouting, ‚ÄúReverse ferret!‚Äù This might as well have been the catchphrase of last weekend, the Murdoch outlets having so thoroughly championed a party so deeply unloved by the electorate at large. It should finally be recognised that Sky News and certain newspapers are no longer news services, and they are in part responsible for the resounding thrashing of Peter Dutton and his team. No less complicit are some aggressive and out-of-touch talkback radio stations. For a long time, these outlets have operated as the media arm of the Coalition, seeing themselves as players in a political game. They chose their champions, kicked their foes and obfuscated any debate. Our country is poorer today as a result. For the past three years, they have found it impossible to admit they lost the previous election, let alone genuinely look at why. They have learnt nothing and did it all again this time. Operating from within the same vacuum, sustaining lies and hatred and simply refusing to listen to any other opinions, ideas or policies. Pretending that Albanese was invisible for nearly three years turned out to be a fatal flaw in their plan. For three years these outlets insisted the prime minister was doing nothing, not getting the right meetings, or simply absent. They sustained these fallacies by refusing to report real news on what he was actually doing about the cost of living, energy and so on, all the while crowing about the great alternative in their mate ‚ÄúDutts‚Äù, even insisting the opposition leader was ‚Äúrunning the show‚Äù. Even the bookies believed their bullshit, such has been the power of the press. Then disaster. Five weeks out, as campaigning hit its straps, they had to actually report in real time what the prime minister was doing, every day. This bit hard. He had policies that he could back up, he was confident and composed, in charge, on top of the detail, and he connected easily with people from all walks of life. They couldn‚Äôt have got this more wrong. Here was the real deal, a Rabbitohs supporter from the burbs, a genuine fan of Australian rock. Having kept him hidden for so long, they simply couldn‚Äôt handle the reality, or the competition. Overall, throughout the campaign, the media tended to dumb down the political discourse, focusing more on its entertainment value ‚Äì the colour and movement ‚Äì and ignoring policy. Those who travelled on the buses with the leaders were easily constrained by the leaders‚Äô messages of the day, unwilling or unable to dig into the detail behind them. At best, they hoped for a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù moment or some crowd disruption in the daily presser to supply just enough grabs for the evening news. All this suited Dutton and his News Corp mates. He would simply claim he‚Äôd fix the economy and control inflation, be the leader who restored home ownership and the Australian dream, knowing he would never be called on for the detail but could expect headlines for the claims. By comparison, on the Labor side, Australians also got to see a well-functioning, unified front bench. Thus far the good and exhaustive work done by the likes of Jim Chalmers, Penny Wong and Don Farrell had gone unheralded, totally ignored and misrepresented along the way. If they were ever mentioned it was, at best, rude; at worst, bordering on defamatory. Chris Bowen was described continually by one particularly grubby radio host in the most obscene way, slurs picked up enthusiastically by hosts at Sky News. Which is why it was so jarring, as the campaign unfolded, to see an increasingly desperate Dutton calling both the ABC and Guardian Australia ‚Äúhate media‚Äù. In no way did they approximate the vitriol of the right-wing press and, as for coverage, his claims of bias were staggering given the total support and saturation coverage of his clearly under-prepared team. It is noteworthy that the assessment of the election result by both former prime minister Tony Abbott and his former chief of staff and now Sky News host Peta Credlin was there should have been more culture wars. More hate. The nightly bias, spit and bile rants led by Chris Kenny, Andrew Bolt, Credlin, Paul Murray and the rest were designed to influence talking points and form strategy for the alternative government. Dutton built his leadership on a revamp of the Abbott‚ÄìCredlin disaster, pursuing negativity and divisiveness on every issue and seeking to undermine the credibility of Albanese and his government. He refused to see any merit in any idea or initiative, whether it was in the country‚Äôs interests or not. Dutton persisted with this strategy, expecting to build on the success he‚Äôd enjoyed in thwarting the Indigenous Voice to Parliament referendum, supported by his media chorus. This was a miscalculation; these votes were never going to be transferrable. However, that said, Sky News, with their audience of frankly two and a dog, is not even the main culprit here. The print media was complicit, clearly forming the basis of much of the drivel that ran on the Murdoch-owned news channel. A daily visit to our local coffee shop told the story. Every day, The Australian and The Daily Telegraph in particular heralded glowing near-achievements of Peter Dutton, alongside thinly veiled attacks on Bowen, Chalmers and Wong. It was also astonishing to see television debates awarded to Sky, all of which were poorly run, one-sided embarrassments, along with the soft, sop-piece interview with Paul Murray. That was unedifying and probably embarrassing even to Peter Dutton himself. Channel Seven‚Äôs debate and subsequent election coverage was well considered, entertaining and featured good panels and fair hosting. The guests were polite and informative without the hate-filled representations found on some other networks. When it came to Dutton boldly declaring in that debate that a dozen eggs cost $4.20, Albanese‚Äôs reply was an affable correction of his opponent (albeit he was still short by a dollar), showing a viewing public that he did understand the cost of living. That said, surely we can hope future debates of such importance will be conducted by the national broadcaster and available to all Australians. I feel it‚Äôs important to point out the ABC was a clear winner on election night, with ratings holding the top three spots by miles. Despite sustained attacks, the national broadcaster remains Australia‚Äôs most-trusted news source. In all of this, the newspapers have ignored their responsibility to focus on the truth. They exaggerated, misrepresented and tried to shape the country‚Äôs future to suit their own agendas, but all they really succeeded in doing was failing the public. They simply ignored their responsibilities and didn‚Äôt report the news. Australians, they obviously felt, were not entitled to facts or to form their own opinions and make up their own minds. Surely the influence of these ignorant media stooges has to come to an end. They are simply gauche entertainment for their MAGA devotees. The magnitude of this election victory in the face of such adversity must surely call into question their continuing relevance. Sadly, we had to wait until Dutton‚Äôs concession speech to see the best of the opposition leader, when he seemed actually to be more at ease, perhaps more himself. What a pity. Much has been made of the election result in the post-mortem and wash-up. It was catastrophic, the Liberal Party with barely any representation in the major capital cities is now simply a regional party without a regional strategy. Much can and will be made of how it came to this, but I can‚Äôt help but wonder what might have been. It‚Äôs not inconceivable that the likes of Allegra Spender could have been shadow treasurer and Monique Ryan shadow health minister, within a party far more widely in tune with women and youth, if they had been allowed to find a place within the Liberals. It‚Äôs not simply a matter of changing leader; the whole parliamentary team have to be engaged in policy development. It was arrogant to pretend the election could have been won simply by being negative and divisive, with poor planning and thin policies. While the Liberal Party‚Äôs identity as a broad church was always aspirational, this is exactly what the party now needs to be. If they have learnt anything from recent history, it should be that they can‚Äôt take voters for granted. QUOTE ENDS # AusPol # WhyIsLabor # HahahahaLiebs # NatsAreNuts # OzElection2025",

THE REAL VICTORY to come out of the 2025 Federal Election is the record number of women who will make up the nation‚Äôs new parliament. . It's a sign of the times, but it also marks a shifting voter base that has no qualms in swiping right on representatives for as long as it takes to find the right one. . These aren't policies. These are views, where policies should be. Women in need of safety and security. Women in need of a protector to ward off the dangers their environment poses to them: homelessness, domestic violence, relationships. . Incidentally, these descriptions are not of women, either. They are descriptions of ideas about women. Dutton doesn't see women as people because he doesn't see them at all. It's not that women aren't equal ‚Äî it's that they aren't real. To Dutton, they are an absraction. . Children, in Dutton's world view, are a vulnerability ‚Äî worthy of protection but not worthy of more. For the women who get put in the same basket as their children, the Opposition Leader could not sound more paternalistic. . Nothing could feel more condescending than a man, who will not shift his world view to include you in it. Not even when directly asked. . Equality exists for the Liberals but only conceptually. They can't implement it. How could they? Their policies for women sound as invented as their ideas about them ‚Äî hollow, but mostly, imaginary. They can't be applied to the real world. They'd have to reflect real life first. . If a party's political platform is anti-diversity, then it may as well brand itself as inbred. For a party that decides diversity is the new enemy, how will it receive new input? With no new input, the party denies itself the chance to ever correct itself, to learn by trial and error or to learn at all. It robs itself of the chance to improve on the past. Ultimately, it won't. # AusPol # WhyIsLabor # HahahahaLiebs # NatsAreNuts # OzElection2025",

    "content": "https://www. canberratimes.com.au/story/896 2371/climate-200-backed-independent-jessie-price-shakes-up-bean/ QUOTE BEGINS It's the shock federal election result that has rattled ACT Labor and could herald a new era for the so-called community independents movement, with its rallying cry of \"no safe seats\". In the formerly safe Labor seat of Bean, independent candidate Jessie Price has obliterated Labor incumbent MP David Smith's 12.9 per cent margin and appears on the cusp of winning with 50.09 per cent of the two-candidate preferred vote - although postal votes are still being counted. With all election day and pre-poll ballot papers counted, Ms Price is ahead by just 165 votes on Friday afternoon - a trend that, if it continues, would make her the first Climate 200-backed independent to steal a Labor seat. While the final result could take weeks, she declares \"the community of Bean has won\" and that voters in the electorate, in Canberra's south, can no longer be ignored. So how did a midwife and former journalist achieve such a feat, at an election that expanded the Albanese government's parliamentary majority in a landslide Labor victory? Ms Price says she ran a positive campaign and that, when talking with people in the community, \"we've had a real sense of how keen people are for change\", while acknowledging that her two-candidate preferred result is buoyed by Liberal and Greens preferences. Depending on who you talk to, the result in Bean is an example of people power in action, or an accident of the preferential voting system. Either way, it's sure to give encouragement to the Voices independent movement in the territory and elevate the concerns of voters who say they've been forgotten. In March, Climate 200 founder Simon Holmes a Court declared the seat of Bean in play, citing polling showed \"strong support\" for Ms Price and saying ACT voters had an appetite for community independents thanks to the popularity of ACT senator David Pocock. But when she quickly overtook Liberal candidate David Lamerton in the two-candidate preferred race on election night to emerge as a potential winner of Bean, many political commentators were taken by surprise. Ms Price has declared $54,000 in funding from Climate 200 and says about $110,000 was raised through small donations in the community, saying her campaign has been far leaner than Senator Pocock's $1.8 million bid to blast former Liberal senator Zed Seselja out of the Senate in 2022. Her highly organised campaign counts more than 250 volunteers, who've spent months doorknocking and campaigning at local shopping centres and markets, while maintaining a strong social media presence. \"Every volunteer has been letter boxing, out talking with people in their community, just putting in such an effort to get our own community independent up, and it really has come through because of that people power,\" Ms Price says. Bean constituents who spoke to The Canberra Times at Tuggeranong's Southpoint shopping centre this week have a variety of views on how the once-safe Labor territory came under siege. Bonython's Elizabeth Parr, who voted for the Liberal Party, says she preferenced Ms Price over Labor to \"keep as many of them [Labor MPs] out of parliament as possible.\" \"When I read her [Ms Price's] policies, I thought she was another teal or greenie disguised. She was funded by Climate 200, and I'm not into the whole thing about climate change, but she seems very nice,\" she says. Ms Parr says it was \"unwise\" for then opposition leader Peter Dutton to propose getting rid of public servants and that he'd run a \"very disappointing campaign\". \"I'm very, very sad that Australians voted for the ALP,\" she says. Keiran, 24, who works at Tuggeranong, says he did not know either candidate but voted for the Greens. \"Being real with us [voters] is the most important thing to me. I hate it when anything is sugar-coated,\" he says. Denis McDermott has lived in the nearby suburb of Conder for 25 years. The long-time ALP supporter says he was surprised Mr Smith did not breeze back into his seat after a comfortable win in 2022 but believes \"complacency\" is behind the swing towards Ms Price. \"David Pocock as an independent has really captured the imagination,\" he says. \"People have seen what an independent can do.\" So compelling was Ms Price's pitch to progressives in Canberra's south that she attracted dozens of volunteers from among Greens members - leaving the minor party's candidate Sam Carter to campaign alone at times as supporters switched allegiances. \"A lot of those people said they identified Jessie as a stronger prospect for election,\" he tells this masthead. At the ballot box, a 5.62 per cent swing was recorded against the Greens, with Mr Carter attracting just 9.18 per cent of first preference votes. Liberal candidate David Lamerton suffered a 6.71 per cent swing to record 23.01 per cent of the primary vote, attributed at least in part to then Opposition Leader Peter Dutton's campaign pledge to cut the Australian public service by 41,000 employees \"in Canberra\". Mr Smith barely suffered a swing, polling just 0.74 per cent fewer first-preference votes than in 2022, attracting 40.99 per cent - by far the largest proportion - of the primary vote in Bean. Ms Price, who polled 26.81 per cent of the primary vote, was preferenced above Labor by both the Liberals and Greens - with the latter prompting ACT Labor to print off how-to-vote cards urging Greens voters in Bean to put Labor second. She says if she's declared as the Bean MP, she will \"draw on the good ideas from right across the political spectrum\". Mr Smith, the second-term Labor MP for Bean, has been criticised for not being visible enough as a local member and he did himself no favours by skipping a candidate forum in March. In the final weeks of the election campaign, he was able to announce a $3.8 million Albanese government pre-election pledge to save the Interchange health co-operative, which provides bulk-billed GP care to vulnerable patients in Tuggeranong. But it may prove insufficient to counter Ms Price's campaign message that an independent is the best hope for voters in the seat. On budget night in March, the independent candidate was ready to deliver her critique on behalf of Bean voters, calling out a lack of funding to fix local roads, such as Hindmarsh Drive. Mr Smith, who says he has worked hard for his constituents, focused his campaign on stopping Mr Dutton from forming government. He says the collapse in the Liberal vote took him by surprise. \"Normally it would be a badge of honour for me not to get many votes with Liberal preferences.\" QUOTE ENDS # AusPol # HahahahaLiebs # WhyIsLabor # NatsAreNuts # OzElection2025",

    "content": "https://www. canberratimes.com.au/story/896 2377/waterford-albaneses-boldness-and-duttons-resignation-explained/ QUOTE BEGINS Some of the most memorable best political speeches made in Australia are made by politicians going out of office. Kim Beazley gave a cracker when leaving Parliament, and fairly good ones conceding defeat by John Howard in 1988 and 2001. It was said that if he had been able to move and inspire people and rally troops during his political lifetime, he would not have been spending so much time acknowledging his and his party's failures. Victory speeches are usually a bit more humdrum, even if given before an excited and jubilant crowd. For starters those who craft them (the speechwriters usually prepare two, one for victory, one for defeat) feel obliged to include clich√© phrases such as \"great honour,\" \"humbled and with a deep feeling of responsibility\" ... \"We will govern for all Australians\", and \"tomorrow we will hit the ground running\". The credit and acknowledgements, win or lose, to campaign staff, party organisers, fallen comrades, and family, these days run longer than the credits on an Oscar-winning movie. Anthony Albanese's speech contained all of this, from a template borrowed, I think, from William Morris Hughes 110 years ago. Optimism, hope and substance are often the first things edited out. Even more from a leader, a government that has seemed timid about its social commitments and its moral duties. But a triumphant, if modest, Albanese unleashed the puppy. There was something in the middle that was worth notice. It reached no heights of oratory. Albanese doesn't do fluency or silken words - or read them well if someone else penned them. He has no great or fast wit, though he can see further through a brick wall than most and knows immediately if someone has stumbled. But his meanings are genuine enough. He usually believes in what he is saying. That is, if he is not merely going through the motions, as he is perhaps when reading some of the 10 speeches or statements he gives a day. His was not a speech brimming with statistics. He was not explaining why his aspirations for human betterment were low. He was not being defensive or resorting to redefinitions. Nor did he use the language of economics or rationing. He did not act as if the laws of economics decreed that an input of X here produced a Y somewhere else, self-evidently a good thing. Compared with some percentage of the gross domestic product there, which would have this effect on interest rates. Nor did he pander to ideas about lifting and leaning and the idea that half the population are not real citizens because they do not contribute. His words did not have to be parsed to be sure that they excised words of legal entitlement or subsumed previously made threats of disentitlement - the stuff of robodebt under a previous regime. Albo addressed citizens, not the forces of production, and in inclusive language. The speech was general and inclusive in its scope. It actually spoke to people. To individuals. To families and communities. Even to the whole nation. It did not seek to divide the population into them and us. It used the words \"you\" and \"us\". There was nothing particularly remarkable about what was said, other than it gave some hint of what government was all about. \"When it comes to Australia's future, all of us have so much reason to be optimistic,\" Albanese said. \"Because when we look at everything going on around the world today, when we consider the changes that will be the future of the world economy, when we think about our people and their smarts and truly there is nowhere else you would rather be than right here ... \"This is a time of profound opportunity for our nation. We have everything we need to seize this moment and make it our own. And we must do it together, all of us. Because for Australia to realise our full potential, for our nation to be the very best, every Australian must have the opportunity to be their best. To serve Australian values, we must value every Australian. Every Australian who wants a fair go at work, fair wages for their work, and the right to disconnect when they are done with work. Every Australian who deserves the security of a roof over their head or who dreams of owning their own home. Every woman who wants her contribution to our economy and society to be valued equally. \"Every parent who wants their child to get the best start in life, with cheaper childcare and with fair funding for every student in every school. Everyone who counts on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. \"We will be a government for every Australian who wants to train or re-train for new skills and a good job at public TAFE. Every Australian who works hard for the life-changing opportunity of higher education ...\" These are not, of themselves, new campaign commitments. But one would be entitled to assume that it implied that social expenditure, on health, education and social services, was at the top of the government's list of things to do. And not merely because a pollster or an economist had said that this was the main priority but because these were among the key reasons why we have government at all. Defence, law and order, industry policy and infrastructure provision are important, including in meeting the social commitments. They are words that Albanese has said before. But he has nicely put them forward in a bold manner, rather than, as he has sometimes seemed to do, apologised for the way these priority commitments fall into our cost of living. At least, one might say, he has repudiated the idea that the bag of money for health, welfare and education can be raided to meet our absurd defence commitments, salmon farms in Tasmania or new coal plants. Peter Dutton must have known he had lost long before his concession speech. But he was in a world of pain from the rejection he had received, firstly by his own electorate and from the whole nation. He showed some guts and some decency in accepting responsibility for the verdict on his campaign, and in praising the Labor candidate, Ali France, who now held his seat. But he eschewed any opportunity for any reflection on what the election result meant, or a defence of his philosophy or his party's philosophy. He gave no short account of what had brought him into politics, and why he thought he had been rejected by the silent Australians. He expressed no regrets for taking actions in his ministry which had seemed gratuitously cruel to people who had come to Australia for safety from persecution and war. Nor did he express any regret for some of his polarising statements which attacked disadvantaged Australians, including Indigenous Australians, refugees, immigrants and juvenile offenders. It may be that he has no regrets, though some of his supporters have always insisted that there is, behind that hard-man face, a man of decency, empathy and feeling for others. Perhaps he judged that this was not the occasion. He was certainly aware that his pollsters had told him that his very personality and character were campaign issues, and that many of those he had alienated feared or despised him. Of course, it is true that few men or women leave politics of their own choosing. Ask some of the Greens, about whose fate Albanese jeered even as he was calling for respect for the demolished Dutton. Albanese, obviously, has a thing against the Greens, even as he hopes and expects that they will support Labor legislation in the Senate, and even as he has relied on Green preferences to create his majority government. He must differentiate the Labor product from the Green, but the lack of proportion in the way that he does so ought to serve as a reminder that he has yet to stamp his place in history, even as the Greens have ensured their own. For the moment, however, observers should notice, and applaud some hint of passion, boldness, defiance and unwillingness to give an inch on core values. Previously, he had a tiny majority. Now he has a big one that ought to foreshadow a new resolution. Perhaps a transformation of the sort delivered by the Great Oz to the lion, the scarecrow and the woodman. We need more of the passion that admirers said was worn on his sleeves. Perhaps that is evident to his colleagues and friends, but it has not been obvious to ordinary Australians. We need more courage, more common sense and more heart. But we also need a new communication between the prime minister and the electorate. We need him thinking aloud. We need him being open to discussion about the merits and demerits of policies, rather than holding everything to his chest. We need him talking aloud, explaining what he is doing and why. And why he is not doing other things on the agenda. The government ought to be in a continuous dialogue with the governed. If the prime minister is shy, secretive and distrustful of the electorate, more junior and open ministers cannot substitute. Or dare to. Most politicians go into politics because they want to make a difference to people's lives. Whatever side one is on, it is not usually about power or the mechanical ways of making others conform to your will or seeing your logic. Nor is it to provide the opportunity for graft and corruption. The attraction is that many of the things in politics matter. Individuals, parties and the political process can make a difference, can change lives and outcomes. It is because politics involves choice and the division of the pie, and because there is never enough pie for everyone. It's why able and ambitious politicians put up with the bastardries, the public disdain of their profession and their kind, and the suspicion of their motives and their honesty. Why they elbow their colleagues aside in quests for power and engage in character assassination. Why they engage in fake debates, pretending sometimes that relatively innocuous statements outrage public decency. It's the heart in politics which speaks to character. Some politicians are very wary of displaying any heart or any emotion. That may lead to empathy and draw people to you. But it may drive others away or be seen to represent weakness and vulnerability. The risk-averse will cower. Fundamental character, heart, and passion, and motivating force can be just the ingredient worth looking for. In the modern day, there is often a vacuum at the surface. Many decisions do not come from deep conviction or ideology, but experience, relatively sensible management of people and things. It may soon be done by AI. The vision stuff, the philosophy stuff, and the priority stuff, are not mere baggage. They are usually the only things that make politicians human. For the humans on whose goodwill politicians depend, affection will depend on humanity they display, not their technical skill, their managerialist mantras or the demands that we should trust them.

    "content": "https://www. crikey.com.au/2025/05/09/clima te-200-candidates-election/ QUOTE BEGINS An evergreen point of clarification: Climate 200 does not select candidates or run independent campaigns. The funding aggregator supports community-nominated indies, trying to ensure donors‚Äô money goes where it‚Äôs most effective. It unfortunately bears repeating, since so much of the media refuses to accept that convenor Simon Holmes √† Court is not the movement‚Äôs ‚Äúpuppet master‚Äù, or even a major donor, contributing only a small fraction of the money raised, which is itself only a portion of each independent‚Äôs piggy bank. That said, Climate 200 was supporting a lot of candidates this year ‚Äî 35, according to its website. So how‚Äôd it do? You probably haven‚Äôt heard much, in part because there haven‚Äôt been any big wins, like in 2022, when blue-ribbon seats fell like dominoes. But seven of the eight incumbents that Climate 200 supported retained their seats, with the exception of Zoe Daniel, who lost to an insanely determined Tim Wilson (previous beneficiaries David Pocock and Zali Steggall forewent funding this time, ‚Äúgraduating‚Äù from the mothership). Sophomores Sophie Scamps, Kate Chaney and Allegra Spender all increased their margins ‚Äî no small feat given the resources thrown at defeating the ‚Äúteals‚Äù. Of the 27 candidates who Climate 200 helped contest seats, the best chance of a win is in Bean in the ACT, where midwife Jessie Price is narrowly ahead of Labor. Kate Hulett gave Labor a scare in Fremantle, after doing the same at the state level, showing climate-focused independents are coming for both sides ‚Äî with a message for Anthony Albanese, should he choose to heed it. But it was a disappointing night for return favourites Alex Dyson and Caz Heise, regional indies I spoke to for Well Hung. ‚ÄúShadow member for Bradfield‚Äù Nicolette Boele is still in the race, just. There are still six Liberal-held seats where the independent could pull through: Bradfield, Monash, Flinders, Grey, Fisher and Forrest. Any of these could flip if preferences flow in the independent‚Äôs favour, with the AEC conducting a record number of 3CP counts (Grey is particularly close). And yet indies may end up falling short in all six. Asked on Thursday night about Climate 200‚Äôs success rate, Holmes √† Court says the numbers are still in flux. But a seat or two could make a world of difference to how the result is read. ‚ÄúIf the crossbench had lost three [community independents], people would say, ‚ÄòOh, that was just a Morrison-fuelled bubble and it was never a real thing,‚Äô‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut if it went forward three seats, the media would be writing, ‚ÄòThis is a genius movement, the movement‚Äôs here to stay, and it‚Äôs a fundamental realignment of Australian democracy‚Äô ‚Ä¶ The difference between those two extremes is a thousand votes in half a dozen seats. If you win or lose, it‚Äôs seen as everything, but it‚Äôs still only a few hundred votes.‚Äù Even without wins, there are impressive swings. First-time candidate Michelle Milthorpe cut Sussan Ley‚Äôs margin from 16.4% to just over 5% ‚Äî something now being splashed across Liberal leadership shit sheets. The same goes for the LNP‚Äôs Fisher, where Keryn Jones looks set to finish second ‚Äî though the AEC is still showing a Labor/LNP count. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no silver medal in politics, but if they did hand out medals, 22 community groups would be walking away with gold or silver after last weekend,‚Äù says Holmes √† Court. But politics is, as they say, a numbers game. ALP powerbroker Don Farrell has been out gloating about their majority, telling the Daily Telegraph the ‚Äúteals can‚Äôt blackmail us‚Äù now. And there‚Äôs no avoiding the disappointments in Cowper and Wannon ‚Äî the latter of which received a significant chunk of funds, yet saw a slight 2CP swing to the Libs, bucking the trend. Some suggest Climate 200 is wasting its resources in the country, where the ‚Äúteal‚Äù association may hurt more than it helps. After all, a regional indie did win big this election, in Calare ‚Äî just not the Climate 200-backed one. On future strategy, Holmes √† Court offers no comment, but points to the thousands of local donors who also wanted better representation in these areas, saying Climate 200‚Äôs 33,000 donors were proud to help. So how does he feel overall, given the fact this was clearly not Climate 200‚Äôs election? ‚ÄúThe movement has come out even stronger than it was at the end of 2022,‚Äù he says, noting that 1 million people voted independent this election ‚Äî up from 776,000 in 2022. ‚ÄúSo many metrics have moved in the right direction.‚Äù While the Greens went backwards in this election, Holmes √† Court is certain climate is still important to Australian voters, pointing to how Liberal Andrew Constance inadvertently raised $1 million for the group after suggesting the Coalition would abandon the commitment to set a 2035 emissions target. ‚ÄúThat, plus our internal polling, showed that climate was never off the table,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúA lot of media like to think that voters could only hold the idea of cost of living in their heads and nothing else. But if you ask people questions that teased out whether they cared about climate still, it was still very salient.‚Äù Another lesson for Albanese, should he be able to hear it amid his victory.

    "content": "https://www. crikey.com.au/2025/05/09/liber al-leadership-angus-taylor-jacinta-nampijinpa-price-sussan-ley/ QUOTE BEGINS With Sussan Ley formally announcing her candidacy for the Liberal Party leadership, Dan Tehan saying he won‚Äôt contest, and Angus Taylor boasting of obtaining the defection of Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as part of his leadership bid, the stage is set for a bitter leadership struggle ‚Äî as well as a possible long-term battle between moderates and right-wingers. And that‚Äôs a battle from which only Labor will benefit. A Taylor-Price leadership team would be a sharp veer to the Trumpian right, in effect making the Liberals even more a vehicle for culture wars, punching down, strident climate denialism and Gina Rinehart-inspired economic policies. Sky News viewers wouldn‚Äôt need to watch the channel anymore, they could just tune in to parliamentary broadcasts. It‚Äôs also a team loaded with risk. As Price demonstrated during the election campaign, she‚Äôs a very loose cannon. Not only did she deliberately channel Donald Trump when Peter Dutton was carefully trying to distance himself from the Mad King, but she also overshadowed her leader at one of his media conferences and contradicted him on education policy. As one Coalition MP has since said, it seemed Price ‚Äúannounced whatever she wanted, whenever, day after day‚Äù. If you think that behaviour will abate once she‚Äôs deputy leader ‚Äî especially given Taylor‚Äôs decidedly low-energy approach to politics ‚Äî think again. Price will be the story, day after day, week after week. And good luck to Taylor in dealing with the Nationals after poaching one of their MPs. Any goodwill in resolving the existential tension between the demands of regional and rural MPs and the need to attract urban voters has evaporated. The idea of a Taylor-Price leadership team is all the weirder because of the reality-defying narrative being peddled by Tony Abbott and the Sky News crowd: that somehow Peter Dutton wasn‚Äôt right-wing enough. A bloke who promised never to stand in front of an Indigenous flag, bagged Welcome to Country ceremonies, demonised Palestinian victims of genocide as potential terrorists, promised a nuclear reactor for every state, and simply made shit up in his quest to tar Labor as antisemitic? If Sussan Ley is successful, however, she will face similar demands to push rightward, but coupled with a bitterness that she beat the right-wing factions within the party‚Äôs federal ranks. The history of the Liberals since the end of the Howard years has been that party moderates are the ones who play by the rules, who fall in loyally even behind right-wing leaders, who stay silent even as policies that could lead them to lose their seats are embraced. The right, meanwhile, will say and do anything to get their way, even if it wrecks the party and risks losing government. The risk is all the worse given the widespread assumption that the Liberals will be out of power for two terms. Without the discipline of believing that they can win government in 2028, the temptation to focus internally might become too great. Progressives might delight at the prospect, but a Liberal Party devoted to slitting each other‚Äôs throats for the next three years means a mediocre-at-best government will face less accountability and scrutiny. Look no further than Victoria for what happens when you get a clutch of Labor duds in power against an unelectable rabble: taxpayers end up paying the price as hubris, incompetence and corruption take over. All the ranting and raving from froth-mouthed reactionaries on Sky News won‚Äôt change that. QUOTE ENDS # AusPol # WhyIsLabor # HahahahaLiebs # NatsAreNuts # OzElection2025",

    "content": "The Greens are projected to pick up six Senate seats, giving them a total of 11. With Labor‚Äôs 28, the government has only three options to pass laws in the upper house: with the support of the Coalition, with the support of the Greens, or by securing the support of every other crossbencher from across the political spectrum. Advance‚Äôs fingerprints are all over this result. Brent said that a scare campaign on the Greens and minority government would have likely driven voters back to Labor: ‚ÄúIf you run around saying Labor‚Äôs going to fall short and they‚Äôre going to need the Greens to government, there‚Äôll be voters who go, ‚ÄòWell I am going to vote Labor instead‚Äô.‚Äù Sheahan said as much when he predicted that Advance‚Äôs Green campaign would bolster the major party votes: ‚ÄúOnce we reduce them, I think what‚Äôll happen is the vote will go back to the main parties.‚Äù Sheahan was, again, half-right. Labor picked up votes ‚Äî presumably including some number from the Greens ‚Äî whereas the Coalition went backwards. Ironically, Advance probably helped Labor build a majority that made its own campaign irrelevant to what happens in the next Parliament. As with all elections, we‚Äôll never know what would have happened if anything was different. Perhaps the Greens were on track to increase their vote nationwide if not for the Advance campaign. Or, perhaps Advance could have tilted the Senate away from Labor and the Greens if it hadn‚Äôt been myopically focused on eliminating Greens MPs. The group‚Äôs mission is about ‚Äúremoving the far-left‚Äôs control‚Äù. Its choice to focus on defeating Greens MPs suggests that the organisation may not have shaken its habit of loud, attention-grabbing campaigns instead of maximising its political impact, even as it has become more sophisticated and well-resourced. If Advance takes the credit for kicking out the Greens, it must also bear responsibility for helping to elect a Parliament with one of the most progressive compositions ever. How Albanese and his government choose to play their hand during the 48th Parliament is up to them. But there‚Äôs no denying that the right-wing‚Äôs loudest voice has helped to stack the deck to the left. QUOTE ENDS # AusPol # WhyIsLabor # HahahahaLiebs # NatsAreNuts # OzElection2025 2/2",

    "content": "https://www. crikey.com.au/2025/05/09/mark- drefus-ed-husic-cabinet-frontbench-richard-marles-anthony-albanese-labor/ QUOTE BEGINS Anthony Albanese, having ascended into the Labor pantheon with a remarkable victory that smashed opponents left and right, has demonstrated his new authority by‚Ä¶ sacking two well-regarded ministers at the behest of his single worst minister, Richard Marles, and replacing them with duds. The defence minister‚Äôs ousting of Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus and Industry Minister Ed Husic has cast a particularly gloomy shadow over what should have been an unalloyed Labor triumph. It also reflects badly on Albanese‚Äôs willingness to use his authority to deliver better government, rather than keep his party‚Äôs factional hacks happy ‚Äî Marles‚Äô Labor Right faction stiffed Dreyfus; in the case of Husic, he was turfed in response to Marles‚Äô demands for NSW to give up a frontbench spot. The replacements for Dreyfus and Husic, Victorian backbenchers Sam Rae and Daniel Mulino, are remarkable in their banality. Mulino, a former Andrews government outer ministry member, has been in Parliament for six years without anyone being aware of his existence. Rae is a Labor Party functionary, a former Victorian state secretary who joined PwC before entering Parliament in 2022. Yes, that PwC, the firm that represents everything toxically wrong with the way government was run under the Coalition. Rae‚Äôs supporters apparently think that‚Äôs something to boast about. As Paul Keating pointed out in blasting Albanese‚Äôs failure to prevent this, the Victorian Right faction, led by Marles, is ‚Äúdemonstrably devoid of creativity and capacity‚Äù. Husic ‚Äî who stood aside for Kristina Keneally to get a frontbench spot in 2019 ‚Äî was charged with implementing Labor‚Äôs idiotic Future Made In Australia pseudo-protectionism, and did so with enthusiasm and capability. For his efforts and loyalty, he‚Äôs been asked to make way again, not for a former premier but a party hack and a backbench nobody. Classy stuff. The ousting of Dreyfus is more serious. Lefties revile the attorney-general for failing to intervene in the prosecution of non-whistleblower David McBride, but he halted the vile, politically authored prosecution of Bernard Collaery, introduced reforms to whistleblower laws from out of the long-shelved Moss review, and finally overhauled the Privacy Act, including introducing a tort for serious invasions of privacy. Dreyfus, like John Faulkner in the Rudd government, was the only consistent advocate within cabinet for more integrity and transparency in government. His departure cripples any internal push to make the Albanese government a better, more accountable one. In that sense, it‚Äôs appropriate that his demise has come at the hands of Marles, who is everything wrong and sordid about the current Labor Party. He is a policy vacuum, with his only apparent belief being the primacy of the US alliance. He is not merely incapable of properly managing an incompetent and potentially corrupt Department of Defence, but he also appears entirely insouciant about its poor performance. After boasting in 2022 that he would fix his department‚Äôs appalling record of slippage on major projects, things worsened under him, with his department also becoming more secretive. Major scandals such as the Thales munitions factory contract have been unveiled on his watch without him batting an eyelid. He appears entirely oblivious to the obvious coming failure of AUKUS, seemingly unable to think outside his ‚ÄúAll The Way With The USA‚Äù mindset. He is the transformation of Labor from a party of bold reformers to a party of mindless, business-as-usual (with the emphasis on looking after business) bureaucrats personified. Again, as Keating points out, Albanese could have intervened, as he has intervened in other factional disputes. Instead, he has sent a strong signal to his frontbench: actual performance and willingness to serve the party loyally are far less important than what the factions want. He‚Äôs allowed a factional brawl to significantly diminish the capacity of the ministry, thus permitting the deadening touch of Marles to break out of Defence like a fungating tumour. In its first term, the Albanese government frequently demonstrated it was a timid, unambitious and craven government. Winning 90+ seats doesn‚Äôt seem to have changed that. Maybe winning all 150 wouldn‚Äôt either. QUOTE ENDS # AusPol # WhyIsLabor # HahahahaLiebs # NatsAreNuts # OzElection2025",

    "content": "https://www. crikey.com.au/2025/05/09/peter -dutton-right-wing-men-conservative-federal-election/ QUOTE BEGINS The alarming far-right radicalisation of gen Z men has delivered Peter Dutton a resounding victory in the ele‚Äî Wait, hold on, that‚Äôs not right. Let‚Äôs try again: the right-wing shift of young men was a mirage. One of several, it seems, that Dutton used as the foundation of his campaign. While a final picture of exactly who voted for which candidates is still months away, it seems much of the political commentary got the read on young men very wrong, largely due to the way it editorialised selective polling data points. This isn‚Äôt just the benefit of hindsight. On February 2, I wrote that the media analysis of a Freshwater poll had missed the forest for the trees, focusing on the youth gender gap among those who already preferred Dutton as prime minister at the exclusion of data from the same poll that showed a majority of young men preferred Anthony Albanese, and that more young men preferred Labor than the LNP. (I also pointed out that women would be the bigger story then, but that‚Äôs by the by.) It only got worse from there, with flawed, narrow analysis in the months that followed from the Australian Financial Review, the ABC, SBS, The Age, Guardian Australia and Sky News. These articles were all seemingly inspired by global developments, in particular the support Donald Trump found with young men in the US presidential election. The ascendence of alt-right personalities online played a significant role in delivering Trump‚Äôs second presidency. Young Australian men are being influenced by this content too ‚Äî there are no borders on the internet ‚Äî but to assume it applies directly to our very different political culture and electoral system was a reach. The theory was fuelled by Dutton‚Äôs campaign strategy ‚Äî as lifted from the Trump playbook in January, with a hint of Zuckerberg ‚Äî weighing in on views around masculinity on podcasts like Straight Talk with Mark Bouris. Some of the articles above did reference young people are significantly more progressive than older generations, and so far do not appear to be becoming more conservative as they age. Young women are moving further left ‚Äî and faster ‚Äî than their male peers; it‚Äôs worth following how this develops. But a gender gap does not equate to young men actively moving to the right. We similarly need to move on from the cliche of young people as a homogenous block of progressive thinkers. Their views vary, as is true for every other generation and cohort. Young men sit at every point on the political spectrum, from right-wing hardliners to centrists to far-left agitators. It‚Äôs curious, though, that in all this speculation around gen Z men‚Äôs voting intention, it was hard to find interviews with voters who had left-wing views. This AFR feature interviewed two young men, one who thinks men have to ‚Äúwalk on eggshells‚Äù and another who believes we‚Äôre experiencing an ‚Äúassault on masculinity‚Äù. Alarmingly, SBS spoke to two young right-wing commentators who peddle racism and misinformation online, to explain why the average gen Z man is shifting to the right. I don‚Äôt doubt their views have been reported faithfully, but damn it‚Äôs bold to cherry-pick these guys as a representation of the entirety of a gender and generation. This analysis is framed around a small selection of right-leaning men, including internet personalities whose views are well-known. Well, whatever they can do, I can do better! John Delmenico is tired of being told he‚Äôs the victim of a male loneliness epidemic. ‚ÄúIf anything I think being a leftist made me less lonely,‚Äù says the 28-year-old editor of The Chaser, a left-leaning satirical news publication that publishes articles like ‚ÄúLabor secures bigger majority, excited to do nothing with it‚Äù. ‚ÄúTurns out it‚Äôs way easier to find a community when you meet people, including men, who agree on beliefs that stem from wanting to lift people up. Shocking, I know.‚Äù His sentiments are echoed by Jol, 19, who tells Crikey: ‚ÄúMost of my friends are leftists, but I do still have one ultra-conservative high school friend. He‚Äôs a member of the Labor Party.‚Äù John and Jol are part of a growing trend of gen Z men, including those who voted for the first time in last weekend‚Äôs election, drifting to the political left. The opinions of these progressive young men are perplexing to pollsters and political commentators, who have spent the past six months trying to retro-fit demographic details from the 2024 US presidential election onto the Australian narrative. The issues of greatest importance to this very specific group of young voters we‚Äôve cherry-picked are sure to dictate the themes for the incoming Parliament. So, what has Australia‚Äôs political discourse misunderstood about the priorities of these progressives? Ryan, 26, says the media, political leaders and society have failed to grasp what‚Äôs of utmost importance to him in 2025: ‚ÄúPalestine, all the way.‚Äù He is horrified at the ‚Äúblanket accusations of antisemitism against people standing against genocide‚Äù and fearful of how it‚Äôs been used to ‚Äúcurtail freedom of protest, particularly in Victoria‚Äù. Wait, so not immigration? Not the war on masculinity? ‚ÄúEither Palestine, or gender abolition ‚Äî burn it all to the ground, you know?‚Äù The gender split between these young men and their female peers is stark. These interviews and a careful selection of data points show that while all gen Z men are shifting to the left, gen Z women are even lefty-er. But, of course, that‚Äôs not very interesting to talk about, so Crikey did not interview any young women about their views. What does this mean for the Coalition and Peter Dutton, who expected to be lifted to victory on the shoulders of a new generation of male Young Libs? When asked if they‚Äôd considered voting for Dutton, the answer from our trio of lads was a resounding ‚Äúfuck no‚Äù. ‚ÄúOn the one hand, clearly if there is something Australia needs more of, it‚Äôs representation for rich, bald white men with glasses,‚Äù John says. ‚ÄúBut personally I wouldn‚Äôt have voted for him due to his awful views, policies and most importantly because H. Fong told me not to.‚Äù Even when Dutton was riding (relatively) high in the polls earlier in the year, Jol never wavered: ‚ÄúI literally never considered it. Never considered voting Labor either.‚Äù Wait, no Labor? Even after such a resounding victory, the fact we‚Äôve failed to turn up any young men voting for the party couldn‚Äôt be a reflection of our methods as a publication and intention to present a specific view, could it? Hmm. I guess we‚Äôll never know. Much to learn and extrapolate. QUOTE ENDS # AusPol # WhyIsLabor # HahahahaLiebs # NatsAreNuts # OzElection2025",

Our current MP is Kevin Hogan who is also the shadow trade minister, meaning if the LNP wins he will be the guy handling all of these trade issues with the US. Page also has Casino, the beef capital of Australia. The LNP want to sidle up to the US but this leaves a conflict of interest - does he side with his electorate and protect the beef industry (which has been a focus of Trump's), or does he side with his party and screw us over? Interestingly, Labor have a candidate in the area called Wendy Backhaus but I can't find any information on her. The ALP site has a list of all candidates: https:// alp.org.au/our-people/our-peop le/ and the seat of Page isn't listed. I would have thought given the global issues right now and who the opposition is here that they might make an effort.

    "content": "The Australian Labor Party made significant gains in this election, confirming 85 Lower House seats, potentially gaining another 7 or more for the party‚Äôs best election win in decades, in a strong rejection of Trump-loving Liberals and now former Liberal leader Potato Dutton who lost his seat to a three time challenger. Anthony Albanese is far from the perfect leader and Prime Minister and their campaign wasn‚Äôt great but they were helped by potentially the most incompetent and weakest Liberal Party ever with a leader who was completely out of touch with his own voters and even supporters. The Liberals lost about a dozen seats last night when they needed to pick up more than that. They embraced Trump just like the Canadian Conservative Party and lost precisely because of it. For the uninitiated, the Liberal Party in Australia, in coalition with the National Party, today is a strongly right wing Conservative Party pretending to be center right and they‚Äôve always been economic liberals, never social liberals. # AusPol # AusPol2025 https://www. abc.net.au/news/2025-05-04/ele ction-result-labor-victory-positive-future/105247606",

Local ACT elections have a 50 metre exclusion zone so you never have to deal with these people. Once I got in the gate, there was a queue that took about 15 minutes to navigate.  Four candidates on the ballot for the House and about 16 for the senate.

Including a rather over-zealous family first spruiker trying to out muscle the standard fare of libs, labor, greens. Voted absentee, easy, quick, no issues, a real pleasure really.  In contrast to what happens in other places where voting is not compulsory. Upon leaving, whilst waiting for my wife, I had a nice lady come up to me and say \"oh I really hate that big white paper\".  I just smiled and agreed it's big, but it's a good system we have in the senate, even with the large white paper.  I reminded her of how lucky we are to have a system like this.

People vote against their own interests when they‚Äôre fed fear-mongering propaganda and denied access to critical thinking skills. The U.S. is indeed a case study in collapse, but Australia isn‚Äôt immune. Here, we‚Äôre already seeing: * Privatised education prioritised over public schools, widening inequality. * Medicare gutted to push privatised healthcare. * A media landscape dominated by one oligarch shaping narratives to serve the wealthy. I have no sympathy for the U.S., but I do care about stopping Australia from replicating its dystopia.

In the lead up, we have welcomed some important investments in essential services, including health, public education and early childhood education. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre astounded that the centrepiece of tonight‚Äôs budget is more dollars for everyone except those with the least. ‚ÄúOnly a year after the last tax cuts, the government is announcing a new set. ‚ÄúWe need a budget and an election that sets us up for the future. The last thing we need is a bidding war on more tax cuts. ‚ÄúIn the face of a serious cost-of-living crisis and overwhelming evidence to fix JobSeeker, to give $7b in tax cuts and do nothing to lift people out of poverty is simply shocking. ‚ÄúThis budget has welcome investments in health, public education and care services, which help to restore years of cuts. Expanding bulk billing and boosting spending on public education will help communities around the country. The women‚Äôs health budget measures are good to see and address some of the gaps in our healthcare system. The guarantee of three days‚Äô early learning is most welcome, especially for families on very low incomes. ‚ÄúThe question for the next government is: how do you keep paying for these critical services upon which we all rely? ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a spending problem. We have a revenue problem. Governments can‚Äôt continue to waste over $30 billion a year on super and capital gains tax breaks for people in the top 10% of incomes. ‚ÄúWe need to close these gaps in the tax and revenue base to meet the community‚Äôs needs ongoing. ‚ÄúWe also need to ensure help goes to people who need it most. The government‚Äôs total $6.8b spend on energy bill rebates could have funded energy upgrades for every social housing property in Australia, permanently reducing bills by thousands of dollars each year. ‚ÄúAs Australia heads toward an election, ACOSS calls on all parties and candidates who wish to form government to embrace an ambitious vision that leaves no one behind. ‚ÄúPeople in Australia are yearning for more substantial reform. They‚Äôve weathered difficult times and deserve a government willing to make bold investments in our shared future.‚Äù # auspol2025 # budget2025",

I knew it wasn't out of nowhere!!! So now I've find the step before: the navies of # Straya and # Aotearoa went on a little date together through the # TaiwanStrait (translation # Australia and # NewZealand sent two naval vessels through the Taiwan Strait) and that's why China's navy is now posturing near us. But WHY??? What the bloody hell was the point of that!? Apparently we were escalating China's trolling us in the # SouthChinaSea Are the # Aussie military just blatantly baiting China to make China do something in response, so that then the # ADF can justify spending more of Australia's money on U.S.American weapons and have an excuse for following the goddamn yanks in to more long stupid pointless immoral imperial quagmires? # ForeverWar I'm somewhat in favour of  Australian supporting our neighbours in the # SouthChinaSea but FFS stick a great big \"not our problem\" sticker on # Taiwan ! Taiwan have the same population as Australia and the same GDP, but Taiwan spend half as much on their military as we do. And our lavish # yanklapdog force is increasingly aimed at a war in the goddamn North Pacific. If Taiwan get attacked we should help refugees and give humanitarian aid. Democracy is nice but if we feel so strongly about # democracy we are LONG over due to dump the USA. Two political parties and zero chance for anyone else doesn't even do a plausible impersonation of a democracy! If our navy want to do some self destructive political posturing we should go hang out for a bit in the Eastern Mediterranean, or maybe we could do something bloody constructive for a change and bring some food and medical supplies to Gaza ? \"Sorry, this heavily armed ship was needed for the rough neighborhood, can we drop off this shipment of essential food and medical supplies?

A better place to start would be August 24, 2018, the day Abbott finally tore down Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister. \"It was an act of pure vengeful bloodletting, led by Dutton, Abbott‚Äôs ideological twin. Even then Dutton failed to convince his party that he was fit to lead. Victory on the day went to God‚Äôs man, Scott Morrison. \"But the purge of the party was well underway.  Turnbull remarked at the time that the hard-right Abbott forces would rather destroy the party than accept the views of the moderates, especially on climate change and energy. \"And so it has transpired. Abbott lost his own seat in 2019, but the hard right ploughed on, oblivious to the evidence.\" # Dutton # LNP # Coalition # NastyParty https:// thepolitics.com.au/behind-ever y-liberal-loser-stands-tony-abbott-hit-man/",

    "content": "Australians have long memories in politics. Over the last 20 years, they have got to know the vibe of the # Coalition very well. They could sense that # Trump is king-pig at the end of slippery pigsty-slope inhabited by hard-right populists like # Howard , like # Abbott , # Morrison , # Dutton and most of his Liberal National colleagues, particularly since the moderates lost to Teals, or to # Liberal factional warring. When Dutton worked out that his Trump-like politics might be problematic, he made a concerted effort to put away the # MAGA hats. This attempt at pivoting was the reason the Coalition‚Äôs campaign looked like such a mess. Asking Dutton and his colleagues to hide their MAGA is like asking the Labor Party not to defend Medicare. Dutton tried # backflipping from # policies , tried to stop talking about # nuclear , worked to present a different face. But ultimately, in the final two weeks, this shapeshifting became too hard and Dutton gave in to his base instincts. He dived back into the culture-warring like a pig in mud with his attacks on # welcomeTocountry ceremonies and his # preference deal with # OneNation . All this did was remind Australians how Trump-like he is. # auspol https:// independentaustralia.net/polit ics/politics-display/coalitions-problems-far-greater-than-a-terrible-campaign,19705?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=IA_Feed",

He appears to ride the political tides based on the nameplate sitting on his desk rather than actually displaying the nous to do the job, any job. His lack of advanced education and a failure to learn on-the-job are at the source of his lacklustre performance. He came to head the party due to the bluster he managed to serve up in the party room, much as a copper will stroll up to a car window and asks the driver if they know what they‚Äôve done before delivering a holier-than-thou pedestrian lecture. It is patently clear that the LNP has lost its way sometime back in the Abbott days and hasn‚Äôt been able to change course. So much for the ‚Äòback on track‚Äô moniker. # AusElection25 # LNP # PolicyAnnouncements When the rubber hits the road, as it does on the hustings, the LNP shows up as the portmanteau for a third grade comedy troupe looking for a venue.  There is a whole generation of ‚Äòliberal‚Äô politicians (using the terms very loosely) and National Party hangers-on which needs to retire before the IND who will get voted in have the means and opportunity to rebuild a Liberal value in Australian  politics. /end_rant",

    "content": "This is as good a painted picture of # Dutton as can be shared: \"At a photo-op on a football field, Dutton managed to kick a ball directly into the head of a cameraman, Ghaith Nadir. Accidents do happen, but Nadir was an Iraqi refugee and asylum seeker, the very type of person Dutton has spent much of his political career vilifying and targeting with punitive policies and rhetoric. That alone gave the incident a clear subtext, but it was Dutton‚Äôs response that turned a simple mishap into something more sinister. Instead of showing concern or even mild embarrassment, Dutton shouted out that he ‚Äúgot him!‚Äù, and then made a joke about the cameraman not catching the ball, laughed it off, and suggested that had it been Albanese, he would have ‚Äòlied‚Äô about the whole incident. It was an oddly triumphant, almost gleeful reaction to an accident that left a man with a head injury, revealing a man more comfortable deflecting with ridicule than showing empathy.\" Source: https://www. patreon.com/posts/how-duttons- fell-126609871 ? # AusPol",

    "content": "Maine unions and community unite for May Day Hundreds of thousands of workers marched and rallied on May Day‚ÄîInternational Workers Day‚Äîmaking it the largest International Workers Day since 2006 when two million immigrant workers left work to demand their rights. Protests were organized in 1,300 locations, large and small; no doubt the first May Day protest in most of these sites. Maine stood out with more than 5,000 participating spread over 26 towns and cities, from Madawaska to Orono to Portland , where almost 2,000 marched and rallied. And in Wayne‚Äîpopulation 1,000‚Äîseventy people turned out for both morning and evening rallies, one of the highest per capita demonstrations in the country. Memory and sacrifice play a role in sustaining working-class culture. No 1886. No Haymarket Martyrs. No May Day. More recently, the 2006 May Day protests provided a living link to the past. And UAW president Sean Fain‚Äôs call for unions to align contracts and lead a 2028 general strike has introduced May Day to a whole new generation of labor organizers. As the saying goes, the best organizing tool is a bad boss and Trump is one of the worst bosses possible. Repression and mass layoffs do not always provoke resistance, but this time targeted workers put up a critical mass of opposition. For instance, thousands of teachers from across the country responded to a call by the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers for walk-ins in March to protest Trump‚Äôs destruction of the Department of Education, including teachers at Deering High School and Rowe Elementary in Portland. And many unions have been fighting the bosses all along, linking struggles in specific workplaces to the more general need to defend working-class rights today. The Maine State Nurses Association led a rally to protest Medicaid cuts in March, organized a mass town hall meeting to prevent the closure of the obstetrics department in the small town of Houlton, and saw some of its most active members take a leading role in May Day. Pair these factors with decades of bi-partisan misery in necessities such as housing, health care, education, inflation, and union busting alongside escalating racism, misogyny, transphobia and homophobia, nationalism, genocidal militarism in Gaza, and anti-immigrant bigotry and it‚Äôs not surprising young workers are angry. But objective conditions do not create action on their own. Organized forces with the credibility and capacity to think through a strategy and then put it into practice are required. Fortunately, Chicago‚Äôs working class has created this necessary element. [Read next: The future of housing is public ] According to Jesse Sharkey, past president of the Chicago Teachers Union and lead organizer with the newly-formed May Day Strong coalition, ‚ÄúChicago became a center of May Day organizing this year for two reasons‚Äîfirst, there was a local coalition that got a lot of people involved. Activists from the immigrants rights community were extremely important in initiating it, and they held open meetings. They invited anyone who wanted to help organize. That drew in trade unionists, and many others. On a second front, Chicago was in the middle of initiating a national call for May Day protests‚Ä¶ The call for that effort came from the Chicago Teachers Union and a handful of allied organizations such as Midwest Academy, Bargaining for the Common Good, and the Action Center on Race and the Economy. The NEA also played an extremely helpful role. In late March, we had about 220 people from over 100 organizations join us in Chicago to start planning for May 1 actions. The reason we were able to initiate such a widespread effort was because we have a past practice of closely linking trade union fights to wider working class demands. In places where local unions have worked with community and activist groups, we had networks of communication and trust. Then, once that effort had reached a certain critical mass, some of the big national networks like Indivisible and 50501 got on board and that really grew the reach of the day.‚Äù It‚Äôs not that the CTU and immigrant community organizers in Chicago were the only ones thinking about May Day, but their action provided a framework to draw together and amplify similar efforts across the country and to nationalize the protest by providing a framework and resources for labor and community organizers in hundreds of towns and cities. Chicago didn‚Äôt create May Day 2025, but it did open a door. Here in Maine, a broad group of organizers came together to walk through that door. Maine DSA‚Äôs Labor Rising working group began discussing May Day plans late in 2024 and we eventually decided to help initiate an organizing meeting open to all community groups and unions . UAW graduate students participated in a preliminary meeting to brainstorm ideas and leaders from the Maine AFL-CIO convened statewide union conference calls. On April 12, more than 70 people attended a meeting in the South Portland Teamsters‚Äô Hall where the group democratically planned Portland‚Äôs May Day and adopted the slogan Strength in Solidarity. Working groups took up all aspects of the action and all important decisions came back to the coalition for votes. By the latter part of April, the Maine Education Association and AFL-CIO leaders called for actions all across the state, amplifying the Chicago May Day Strong call and dramatically broadening what the Portland May Day committee could organize on its own. May Day in Portland began with a rally at the University of Southern Maine to back UAW graduate students‚Äô demands for a first contract, which the administration has stalled for more than 500 days. UAW graduate worker Miranda led the crowd chanting ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs disgusting? Union busting!‚Äù We marched to the Post Office to hear from postal workers, including APWU president Scott Adams. ‚ÄúWhen our postal service is under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!‚Äù Members of the Portland Education Association led the rally at Portland High School and teacher Bobby Shaddox taught everyone to sing an updated version of Billy Bragg‚Äôs There is Power in a Union . ‚ÄúThe union forever, defending our rights, down with the tyrants, all workers unite!‚Äù Headlining the stop, The Pelikanne, a trans high school student poet, shared their own revolutionary vision with all those assembled. From there, we went up the block to Monument Square to hear Jay Gruber, a member of the librarian‚Äôs union, and others at a brief rally before taking Congress Street to march to the final rally at Congress Square Park. Highlights at the final rally included Alana Schaeffer, president of the Metal Trades Council, representing 4,000 workers at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, members of the Maine Coalition for Palestine, Osgood from Portland Outright, Anthony Abdullah from the Maine State Nurses Association, and others. Twenty-five other towns held actions, bringing the total number of Maine participants to over 5,000, the largest Maine May Day anyone can remember. All in all, it was a good day for Maine workers. [Listen to Maine Mural, DSA‚Äôs podcast, latest episode featuring Presente! Maine immigrants rights organizers] We face a long, complicated road where political pressures to return to passivity and demoralization will persist. Trump is happy and he is strong. There‚Äôs no point in underestimating the damage he is going to inflict on working class communities in the coming years. We are not yet powerful enough to stop him. But May Day 2025 constituted a small step towards healing deep wounds in the American working class and it points us in the right direction. What did May Day teach us? Fittingly, the last word goes to Kirsten Roberts, a rank-and-file Chicago teacher. ‚ÄúThe most important element of May Day 2025 is the explicit entry of organized and unorganized labor into resistance to Trump. Trump‚Äôs attacks are aimed directly at dividing the working class and turning ordinary people against one another while the billionaires rob and plunder us all. An agenda for working class unity can be built when we stand up for those most victimized and vilified by the right wing bigots AND when we stand together to fight for the things that the billionaire class has denied us‚Äîthe fight for healthcare, education, housing, and good paying jobs for starters. For decades we‚Äôve been told by both parties that funding war, incarceration, and border militarization are their priorities. May Day showed that working people have another agenda. Now let‚Äôs organize to win it.‚Äù *Parts of this article will appear in an extended form examining May Day 2025 beyond Maine in DSA‚Äôs journal Socialist Forum . #Labor #LifeInMaine #MaineDSA #politics",

It was a grave error. # Lenin in his thesis to the Second Congress of the Communist International warned the white revolutionaries ‚Äî a warning they badly need ‚Äî that such has been the effect of the policy of # imperialism on the relationship between advanced and backward peoples that European Communists will have to make wide concessions to natives of colonial countries in order to overcome the justified prejudice which these feel toward all classes in the oppressing countries.

Since the start of the # election2025 campaigning (back in like October) the Wills # Greens campaign office has been a steady hive of activity, with people calling, organising, meeting and doing stuff at all hours. We've got a real chance of ousting the current CIA-backed, Israel friendly, do-nothing # Labor member and getting another Greens candidate into the lower house, so we've been campaigning, as Tom Gleeson might say, HARD. I'm not too keen on talking (IRL) to randoms about # ausPol , so I've stayed away from doorknocking and calling, instead I've been cooking succulent meals for hungry vols, putting up corflutes, welding frames for giant signs and building A-frames for election day. Tomorrow I'm booth-captaining for a local booth, which means that I've been herding vollies into getting trained up and ready to go on the how-to-votes tomorrow, as well as covering the local primary school with the dreaded bunting and corflutes. Then I'll spend all day smiling at punters and shoving paper into their hands, followed by scrutineering once the polls close. Not exactly looking forward to it, I'd rather spend the weekend chilling in the shed, but I will be satisfied when it's all done that I've been more than a spectator.",

The theory has one justification ‚Äì pegging wage increases to increased productivity (speed up) justifies the contract deals by which labor leaders barter increased discipline over the workers for financial benefits. The alleged relationship between wages and productivity is false in theory and false in fact. Without massive struggles, workers wage increases, tend to fall behind gains in productivity. With massive struggles, wages rise far beyond what productivity gains would indicate.‚Äù ‚Äî George # Rawick The American Working Class (1973) # history # union # unions # MayDay # economics",

They claim: \"60% of sellers on Amazon are Amazon resellers\". These used to be Mom & Pop businesses, till Amazon muscled them out by using big VC cash to undercut them.

    "content": "The # Utah effort to overturn the Legislature's new law banning collective bargaining by public sector # labor # union s is looking good, according to the @sltrib . The signature-gathering effort to get a repeal on the ballot has to hit two milestones: 8% of active voters statewide, and 8% of active voters in half of the state senate districts. Signatures have been turned in, and now the state is validating them. The first will be easy, as the petitioners turned in 320,000 vs. the 140,000 they needed state wide. The second is looking very much on track as well, with 11 of the 15 needed met, and 3 more that are getting very close to the threshold. And so far the state has only validated 120,000 of the signatures turned in - though we don't know how many they have rejected, so we don't know if they are 37% through or further than that. But still, looks extremely likely to pass this hurdle. And this is a crazy number of signatures - the most, by far, in state history, so I think it's a *very* good chance that it will pass the vote easily too. https://www. sltrib.com/news/politics/2025/ 04/22/utah-union-referendum-live-updates/",

And, we‚Äôll march on the boss to demand the UMaine system bargain in good faith and sign a union contract with graduate student workers represented by the United Auto Workers. The two go hand in hand. Next, we‚Äôll march to the Post Office on Forest Ave to oppose Trump‚Äôs threats to privatize it and hear from workers threatened with mass layoffs. Then up past Portland High School and the Portland Public Library in solidarity with educators and students opposed to Trump‚Äôs destruction of the Department of Education and his attacks on LGTBQ+ and immigrant students. Finally we‚Äôll march up Congress Street during rush hour to the Portland Museum of Art to support funding for the arts and hold a final community rally starting around 5:00 pm. We‚Äôll have a program of speaking out against Trump‚Äôs attack and offering ideas about how to deepen solidarity between all the different parts of our movement for democracy and justice. We need your help. Please attend the march if you are able. It‚Äôs a big state, so if you can‚Äôt get to Portland, please support or organize another action in your town or region hosted by the Maine Education Association and the Maine AFL-CIO or any other community group that steps up to stand up.

Kristian Williams, author of \"Our Enemies in Blue: Police and Power in America\" and forthcoming \"Policing the Progressive City\" about Portland, leads the discussion. The cops are worried about Portland City Council. They've gotten used to bloated police budgets, absurd overtime payouts, and immunity for violent misconduct.  But with four socialists elected to City Council, the police union is suddenly trying to brand itself as a \"friend of workers\" -- petitioning to join the regional council of labor unions, the Northwest Oregon Labor Council (NOLC). The labor council \"speaks\" for labor at City Council meetings and with elected politicians.  What does this mean for Portlanders fighting for a city budget that doesn't cut their community centers, parks, and services? What does this mean for our efforts to hold Portland police accountable for misconduct? # PortlandOr # PDX # Police # labor Audio at: https:// kboo.fm/media/126840-budget-cu ts-portland-police-and-labor-movement",

    "content": "I'm by no means an expert in Canadian politics, but it doesn't stop me from having strong opinions about it ;-) The news from the Canadian election from last night was very positive. I personally think it will be good for Canada if the Liberal party has to form a minority government, because I think it would be a good thing for the Bloc and the NDP to potentially play a role in forming a new government. But the most important thing was that yesterday's vote was a clear vote against Trump's imperial ambitions and a vote in favor of Canadian sovereignty. On a side note - I am sad for the losses by the NDP. I remember well how the party stood behind the US war resisters who were seeking refuge in Canada during the Iraq and Afghan wars and have long appreciated them for this. That said, I can understand why many leftist voters voted for the Liberals this time, but in the long-term I worry that this could lead to a dilution of multi-party democracy in Canada. # Canada # CanadaPolitics # NDP # Liberal # Bloc # ElbowsUp",

Lawyers acting for # ClimateIntegrity , a not-for-profit focused on corporate accountability, have filed a complaint with the ACCC. They argue that the website and advertising materials of Australians for Natural Gas have failed to disclose its directors‚Äô links to the gas industry and # LiberalParty , and overinflated the role of gas in the economy and energy transition. On its website, Australians for Natural Gas describes itself as a ‚Äúnot-for-profit organisation representing the interests of # AussieHouseholds , industries and producers‚Äù. The company was registered in January 2025 with # JoelRiddle and # NathanielSmith among its directors, according to information provided to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Riddle is the chief executive of the gas company # TamboranResources , which holds the largest share of acreage in the # BeetalooBasin , according to the company‚Äôs website. Smith was installed as the Liberal candidate for the New South Wales seat of # Whitlam after the party‚Äôs initial choice was disendorsed, and was a member of the NSW parliament from 2019 to 2023.‚Äù # AusPol / # LNP / # Nationals / # Coalition / # Energy / # ClimateEmergency < https://www. theguardian.com/environment/20 25/apr/28/pro-gas-group-with-liberal-party-links-referred-accc-over-alleged-misleading-claims-ntwnfb >",

I‚Äôm going to have police on speed dial and I‚Äôm going to explain to my friend a defence posture in handling violent entitled rich people. Any suggestions on what I should carry to scare them off? Maybe one of those loud horns.",

They project themselves as defiantly parochial, unashamedly maroon, with a vested interest in the north. More recently, however, # power has shifted from the # regions to the # urban south-east, which is more likely to welcome new # arrivals from other states than Queensland country towns. Amid all this growth, the lines of # responsibility have blurred between federal, state and even local government. Rather than fighting Canberra, the parties ‚Äì including the Greens, who thrive on street-level combat ‚Äì have taken to # fighting each other. At the last election, the # Greens picked up three seats in Greater # Brisbane , riding the winds of change. The # TealMovement was unsuccessful in its first federal foray into Queensland, in the seat of Groom, although Suzie Holt enjoyed a healthy flow of preferences and is running again. For now, the closest thing Queensland has to # independents are Bob Katter and Gerard Rennick, but the south-east is becoming used to newcomers.‚Äù # AusPol / # Liberal / # LNP / # Nationals / # planning / # GrowthCorridor / # facilities / # transport / # basics < https:// archive.md/7GbkF > / < https://www. brisbanetimes.com.au/national/ queensland/nowhere-is-growing-like-this-corner-of-queensland-it-s-changing-the-political-game-20250415-p5lrzn.html > (paywall)",

Ahem: Pierre Poilievre is a snake.  The comments about him never having actually done anything of value, living off of the federal government's largesse in one way or another, are true but miss the point. He is completely unprincipled.  His \"deeply held beliefs\" are whatever he thinks at this moment are most likely to get him elected.  Trying to determine what he actually believes is the classic nailing-jelly-to-the-wall.  It can't be done. He spent the last several years running on nothing but \"I'm not Justin Trudeau, and don't you hate Justin Trudeau?\"  (Keep in mind I was, and am, deeply critical of Trudeau)  He did this because it appeared likely to be all that was needed to win, and if you don't actually take positions on anything, you can't be criticized for them. He also minored in Trumpism - culture war issues.  Looking south, do you think that means PP *really* believes in a woman's right to choose?  That all people are equal?  That no groups are \"othered\"? You can't pin him down, so assume the worst. PP cannot be allowed to lead this country.  Vote accordingly. # election # Canada # CPC # Liberal # NDP # Conservative",

The good news: Greens and LibDems did well, the movement was away from Conservative (massive), away from Labour (very significant), towards Reform (the nutty rightwingers who don't know how to actually do things), and Greens and LibDems (the people who would be included in UK government if we had proportional representation, PR).

They seem to be strongly vibing the Advance RWNJ bullshit about dark money & unfair influence. It's been documented for years that he is an initiator & facilitator, not a puppeteer, & that the vast majority of C200 money comprises tiny donations from ordinary citizens. What the fuck is wrong with this? Why the fuck is Aunty participating in this FUD?

    "content": "I'll only link to the excellent pieces by Paul Bongiorno [It‚Äôs all over bar the voting] & John Hewson [Peter Dutton‚Äôs empty leadership], but i've fully quoted the Editorial , as i have such visceral hatred of the odious Lyle Shelton. https://www. thesaturdaypaper.com.au/commen t/topic/2025/04/25/its-all-over-bar-the-voting https://www. thesaturdaypaper.com.au/commen t/topic/2025/04/24/peter-duttons-empty-leadership Quote Editorial Sexual preferences Lyle Shelton is the crab louse of Australian politics. He‚Äôs an itchy little man. In his entire career, the only thing he has won is a campaign not to drink recycled sewage. He finally found a cause more unpopular than himself and it was the consumption of human excrement. Shelton led the unsuccessful campaign against same-sex marriage. He argued that anti-discrimination laws needed to be suspended so he could properly put his case. He likened the children of gay couples to the Stolen Generations. Undeterred by his failure, he joined Cory Bernardi‚Äôs Australian Conservatives. He was on top of the Senate ticket in Queensland in 2019, where he won 5533 votes. The anti-fluoride party was more popular. When the Australian Conservatives were deregistered, he switched his allegiance to the Christian Democratic Party. Fred Nile promised to make him leader but betrayed him after he moved to Sydney. This is a little like being tricked by a slow-growing mole. The gay-hating 90-year-old said: ‚ÄúI had high hopes for Mr Shelton and am sorry it has come to this.‚Äù Shelton is now leading Family First. He is running for the party in the Senate in New South Wales. He is still obsessed with sex and death. He describes himself as an advocate for life who ‚Äúopposes abortion-on-demand and euthanasia‚Äù. He wants people to freely practise their faith and promises to ‚Äúcombat harmful gender ideologies and protect children from radical indoctrination in schools‚Äù. Ordinarily, this wouldn‚Äôt matter. The only talent Shelton has shown is for losing. He runs as a husband and a failure. The difference this time is Liberal preferences. Peter Dutton‚Äôs Coalition is listing Family First and One Nation at the top of its how-to-vote cards. For decades, the Liberal Party has avoided preferencing One Nation. When Pauline Hanson emerged as a racist force in the 1990s, senior Liberals worked hard to deprive her party of oxygen. There was a principled stand against her. In the years since, the Liberal Party has changed. Rhetoric that appalled the country in 1996 is now commonplace. There is nothing Hanson said in her first speech that hasn‚Äôt since been repeated by a Liberal leader. She is the definition of the Overton window. Dutton‚Äôs Liberal Party is not embarrassed to swap preferences with One Nation or Family First. They all live on the same fringe. There are differences on abortion and a few other policies, but the fundamentals are the same. The Liberals who fought Hanson struggle to recognise the party now. Its values have been surrendered to its rightmost wing. It has forfeited its economic conservatism, giving in to reactionary policies. It is no longer conflicted over racism. It has no affection for institutions or plans to protect them. When Lyle Shelton looks back at his life, squinting at all the failure and fantasy, it is this that will likely stand as his solitary achievement.

The old Rudd/Turnbull carbon scheme paid polluters to keep polluting. The current govt supports renewables and increased fossil fuel extraction & subsidises gas  eg billions for Darwin Middle Arm LNG. In the 2022 Victorian state election, the Greens primary vote went up approx 1% & gained a lower house seat. Not sure why @tonyr641 thinks it went down, except he's a believer in ALP propaganda. Prahran by-election was unusual - Greens dumped their member over an extramarital affair w a staffer in an excessive reaction (cf Barnaby Joyce) ; former Labor local member Tony Lupton ran as an anti greens campaign ; turnout was down 14% (what happened to compulsory voting VEC?). Greens primary vote was only down 0.2% . Five new candidates shared 22% of the vote. # auspol # vicpol # greens",

As a Greens member, I have to say; we rarely, if ever, want to harm anyone, or anything. Especially if you live in Goulburn rather than in a private island in the Bahamas. You want to vote for Liberals, Nationals, One Nation, Trumpet? Off you go, do what your man tells you to do. I think you're wrong, you think I'm wrong. Luckily, the # greens have a fundamental belief in democracy. (And know how to spell it). I'd happily sit down on the footpath and have a chat with you about all this - no troubles at all.

    "content": "https://www. crikey.com.au/2025/04/15/2025- election-peter-dutton-collapse-liberal-party-future/ quote If the polls are right, the Coalition is headed for defeat. Where does that leave the Liberal Party, which has abandoned so many of its traditions to get here? Peter Dutton is in heaps of trouble. Three polls were put out in the past 24 hours, all showing a growing swing to Labor. They‚Äôre just the latest in a growing list of polls indicating that at first the Coalition‚Äôs momentum had halted and then, point by point, has gone into reverse. When Anthony Albanese talked about kicking with the breeze in the last quarter, he wasn‚Äôt wrong. Worse, Dutton‚Äôs own personal numbers are declining while Albanese‚Äôs are improving. It‚Äôs almost as it, as voters have paid more attention to the leaders as the campaign got under way, they‚Äôve decided that they don‚Äôt like what they see in Dutton. And Dutton has fired his big guns: a revamped low and middle income earner tax offset, and tax deductibility for mortgage interest, announced at the campaign launch on Sunday, added to the petrol excise cut from the budget reply. But Dutton‚Äôs pal Donald Trump has sent the oil price plummeting with his policy chaos. Unlike 2022, no-one is lamenting how much it costs to fill up at the bowser. And the tax offset and tax deductibility were announced at the same time as Labor was offering its own (further) tax cut and 5% deposits for mortgages. Your average disengaged voter would only have noticed both sides throwing money at them on the weekend ‚Äî or Jacinta Nampijinpa Price channeling Trump. And economists have spent the past 36 hours bagging both sides for wasting money and further buggering up the tax system. So after nearly three years, and with just an Easter/ANZAC break and a week of campaigning to go, there‚Äôs a non-trivial chance that Labor could actually increase its tiny majority, leaving the Coalition in an even worse position for the 2028 election than Scott Morrison left it in three years ago. While Dutton and his campaign team think about how they can turn the campaign around and pull Labor‚Äôs lead back, and hope for a 2019-style polling error in their favour, others within Liberal ranks might be reflecting on where such a result might leave them. Failing to win back teal seats (or, in the worst case scenario, failing to win them back and losing more, like Bradfield and Wannon) would lock in those independents and make a medium-term return to government for the Coalition much more difficult. Likely, the Liberals would have to wait until the current incumbents decided to leave politics to have a crack at regaining their seats. If the loss of teal seats was offset by success in outer suburban seats, that would be some comfort that Dutton‚Äôs strategy had been partly effective. But what happens if the latter don‚Äôt swing to the Liberals? Does that mean the strategy was right, but the execution flawed? Or is the whole strategy of refocusing away from what used to be the Liberal heartland in favour of lower-income, more multicultural communities never going to work? That mirrors the Liberals‚Äô ideological dilemma. If Dutton entered the campaign having tossed aside some fundamental Liberal beliefs, with his big-government nuclear power plan and using divestment against big corporations, it is the Liberals‚Äô core competence of fiscal discipline that has been thoroughly trashed in the past few weeks. However ill-deserved the Liberals‚Äô reputation for good fiscal management might be ‚Äî they have long been the party of higher spending and higher taxation, as measured by proportion of Australia‚Äôs GDP ‚Äî voters have until recently assumed that the Liberals would always balance the books. But in the face of voter disenchantment with the benefits of fiscal discipline and the need to combat a fiscally reckless Labor government, Dutton has gone for broke with handouts galore (with more to come on defence spending as well). Unlike John Howard in 2007, however, Dutton is doing so while the budget is mired in deficit, with no return to surplus on the horizon. Angus Taylor, desperately trying to fly the Liberal flag in an outfit run by a Queenslander, can insist the Coalition will have a better fiscal outcome when they release their full costings ‚Äî at this rate, presumably one minute before polls open on May 3 ‚Äî but a Dutton government would still deliver deficits into the 1930s, like Labor. When voters clock that endlessly running up bills on the national credit card only leads to spending tens of billions a year on bond interest rather than, say, health or education, will they remember the now-distant Howard years when achieving surpluses seemed easy (chiefly because Costello taxed us so much?) Or will the Liberals just be Tweedledee to Labor‚Äôs profligate Tweedledum? A win, or a narrow defeat, would vindicate Dutton‚Äôs strategy and his abandonment of Liberal traditions. But a loss along the lines currently suggested by the polls would leave them ideologically and strategically bereft.

But really, sidling up to Advance ain't the way to go. I'll give you a hint: how has sidling up to NewsCorp gone? It isn't good, is it? They have no friends for a reason. You are not their friend. They are not yours. Here is my Home Remedy for the Prevention of Greens Votes: 1. Act on # climate . 2. Help # refugees and the poor. 3. Do something to protect # nature . You don't need to go full on dictatorship-of-the-proletariat. Do those three (actually, for many Greens voters, just the top one would do) and Josh keeps his seat. No wukkas. So simple. Not a biggie, not difficult, definitely not 3D Chess. Put the sock puppets away you bloody gooses.",

It‚Äôs daunting to sort fact from fiction in the Wild West world of online media, where hidden agendas and speculative opinion are rife. All the more so when a party‚Äôs policy only truly makes sense if viewed through a wider lens. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton‚Äôs promise to build seven small-scale nuclear reactors, ostensibly to help meet future energy needs while keeping carbon emissions at bay, therefore needs to be seen for what it really is: a staggeringly bad idea, a stunt and a con. It is a backdoor attempt to pander to the fossil-fuel lobby ‚Äì and under the electoral spotlight, more people will figure that out. Younger voters understandably won‚Äôt know that a generation their age once packed the Sidney Myer Music Bowl with Midnight Oil, INXS and other friends to ‚ÄúStop the Drop‚Äù. They won‚Äôt remember our Nuclear Disarmament Party campaign, which won Senate seats in Western Australia and NSW in the ‚Äô80s. They can‚Äôt know what it was like to grow up during the Cold War era or live through horrific meltdowns at the Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear power plants, which were also ‚Äúcompletely safe‚Äù until the day that they weren‚Äôt. But generations Y and Z can still smell a rotten idea when they give it a good sniff. At first blush, nuclear energy is causing less concern to younger voters, who haven‚Äôt yet taken a closer look. When they do, they will find that most experts and qualified observers view the proposal as expensive, difficult to implement, prone to significant uncertainty and full of rubbery figures. One example is the fanciful assumption that nuclear plants could be built in 12 years. Twenty years would be more likely ‚Äì if they are built at all. Cost overruns and safety issues are equally certain. And the carbon consequences of prolonging our old coal-fired power generators are dire. This deceptive proposal has all the Trumpian hallmarks: a quasi policy announcement intended to serve sectional interests ‚Äì in this case, fossil-fuel conglomerates ‚Äì while simultaneously serving up a cartoon enemy as ideological whipping boy, namely renewable energy. Australia has abundant sunlight, plenty of wind, plus lots of pumped hydro resources that can all be converted by increasingly efficient technologies. Stored batteries are ramping up, too. The butterfly has emerged from the chrysalis and taken to the skies ‚Äì the renewable energy transition is well under way. Construction costs will keep coming down. Supply will keep going up. The future is already here. By wrenching the country off this course, Dutton‚Äôs plan would leave old, dirty, coal-fired power stations staggering on at increasing risk of breakdown, putting off the day of reckoning when we finally stop polluting and heating our world and get on with using affordable, reliable energy that does not cause more climate chaos. What possible reason is there for Australia to embark on building a completely new, expensive energy infrastructure we don‚Äôt need and which, incidentally, is already illegal in states where the reactors are meant to go? Nuclear energy features eye-watering costs, which history repeatedly shows blow out. It features risks associated with managing radioactive waste for tens of thousands of years. It is also a massive safety risk from both accidents and attacks. To cap the charade, this policy comes from the parties that supposedly champion free enterprise and want to reduce government spending, yet the hundreds of billions of dollars needed to fund the Coalition‚Äôs nuclear plan are to be borne by all of us, the taxpayer. Go figure! The trend line is unarguable: renewable energy is cleaner, greener and getting cheaper every year. It will supersede fossil fuels in the blink of an evolutionary eye. Nuclear is a last-gasp delaying tactic. Over 4 million Australian homes and businesses have solar panels on their roofs. South Australia routinely produces 75 per cent and sometimes up to 100 per cent of its power from renewables and is racing towards net zero, with the other states in hot pursuit. Most electricity added to global supply comes from clean energy. When the Climate Change Authority, headed by former NSW Liberal government treasurer Matt Kean, released a report showing Dutton‚Äôs policy would result in a 2 billion-tonne blowout in dirty emissions, the Coalition‚Äôs response was to play the man and not the ball, and threaten Kean. When a group of eminent former defence chiefs raised the spectre of nuclear plants scattered across the country vulnerable to the risk of terrorism and accidents, the Coalition response was virtual silence. When farmers, scientists and community groups questioned the impact on precious groundwater of thirsty nuclear reactors running 24/7, the Coalition response was a shrug. Compare this with Dutton‚Äôs proud promise that if elected, within 50 days he would approve the massive Browse Basin gas development in WA. Due to its size, the Browse project is known as a ‚Äúcarbon bomb‚Äù, given it will release more than 4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide and blow Australia‚Äôs modest greenhouse emissions targets to smithereens. In these circumstances, the Coalition promise of boosting fossil fuels with ‚Äúboutique‚Äù nuclear reactors coming on stream at some mythical future date to satisfy energy needs and reduce costs is an utter chimera. It is best understood as a delaying tactic, an Aussie version of US President Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúdrill baby drill‚Äù, buying more time for multinational carbon producers to keep making super profits and heating the planet at our expense. And there is another effect of the policy: it buttresses claims that Australia should become a site for the storage of large quantities of radioactive nuclear waste generated by other countries. Periodically, there are calls for Australia‚Äôs outback, with its stable geology and low population density, to be the site for disposal of the world‚Äôs radioactive waste. It‚Äôs an idea that has been rejected before, but don‚Äôt expect it to go away soon. Recently, a senior US official chided Australia for not being sufficiently enthusiastic about uranium mining. In the transactional Trumpworld we now inhabit, new AI facilities envisaged by Amazon, Meta, Google and the like are expected to draw vast amounts of power, often touted as coming from nuclear. Given the US still doesn‚Äôt have a licensed, permanent nuclear waste site after 50 years of furious debate and unsuccessful political negotiation, storage and disposal of new streams of radioactive waste will be crucial. If the US president can posit buying Greenland and incorporating Canada as the 51st state, impose tariffs on America‚Äôs trading partners at will, and promise to end the war in Ukraine in a day, who is to say earmarking Australia as an international nuclear waste dump is a fanciful scenario? Can anyone imagine ‚ÄúTemu Trump‚Äù saying no? As for polls showing younger Australians are less concerned about nuclear energy ‚Ä¶ not so fast. I‚Äôm confident that equipped with relevant facts, and mindful of the scale of the climate crisis they have inherited, they‚Äôll see Dutton‚Äôs nuclear con job in a whole new light by the time we get to polling day.

    "content": "https://www. smh.com.au/business/companies/ guardian-political-editor-exits-after-months-of-turmoil-20250314-p5ljql.html Quote Guardian political editor exits after months of turmoil Guardian Australia‚Äôs political editor Karen Middleton has resigned after a year in the job, following a period of turmoil in its federal bureau. Editor Lenore Taylor told staff of the decision late on Friday evening, shortly after Middleton had announced her decision on social media. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm writing to let you know that Karen Middleton has resigned as political editor. I would like to thank Karen for her contribution to Guardian Australia and wish her well in her future endeavours,‚Äù Taylor said in the single paragraph email. Middleton told her social media followers she planned on continuing in political journalism, despite having taken several months of medical leave. ‚ÄúAfter an extended period of medical leave, I have decided to resign from Guardian Australia,‚Äù Middleton said. ‚ÄúI thank the many colleagues who were welcoming and collaborative during my time there.‚Äù ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be making any further comment.‚Äù She joined The Guardian in March last year after long term political editor Katharine Murphy left to join the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese‚Äôs office as press secretary. Her time at the bureau coincided with a period of instability, during which a number of staff including chief political correspondent Paul Karp, reporters Amy Remeikis, Daniel Hurst and veteran photographer Mike Bowers left. Her departure follows an interview process of Canberra-based staff, questioned after Middleton and Karp made counter claims of workplace misconduct against each other in late 2024. During an exit speech to staff, Karp claimed he was leaving with a ‚Äúclean record‚Äù. Middleton had more than three decades of experience reporting on federal politics in Canberra. She joined from The Saturday Paper, and is a regular Insiders panelist on the ABC. Taylor confirmed a hiring process to replace Middleton will begin imminently. Middleton‚Äôs departure means the Guardian‚Äôs Canberra bureau is likely to be without a political editor for its coverage of the upcoming federal election, due to be called late this month or in early April.

You laughed and laughed at anyone saying this before 6 January. The USA has changed its advertising campaign - that's all. No fundamental change underneath. Just a new logo and new straplines. They are as selfish, fat (and stupid/smart) as they always were. # Australia needs to go it alone on foreign and military policy, now - just exactly as much as we needed to in the past.  Not specially now. Not 'wow this is new' now. Not because of anything a knuckle-dragging jaundice painted sex offender has said now. Because this - since at least the end of the Cold War - has been an abusive relationship. <rant> Just a few months ago, Albanese was calling # Greens \"radical\" and \"student politicians\" and worse - for expressing what is now centerline opinion. He is only just up to sending Rudd and Wong out to fly the kite for the idea. Fuck him, and fuck you too if you agree with him. For the numbnuts up the back in the ALP: \"It's Time\". For everyone else, the wayback machine gives a view of # Greens policies more than twenty years ago: http:// web.archive.org/web/2002052519 5250/http://www.greens.org.au:80/ ... You tell me what's changed. (its the fonts, right? we've got better at fonts üôÇ ) I feel like the 'centre / centre-left' should pull their heads out of their arseholes just long enough to mumble 'sorry, you were right all along'. </rant> # VoteGreen",

    "content": "The quest of getting rid of the greens shall continue... > Welcome to The Lupton Factor - by Tony Lupton https://theluptonfactor.substack.com/p/welcome-to-the-lupton-factor QUOTE Our liberal democracy is under threat from identity politics and extremism. The moral confusion and relativism of identity politics has fractured society and weakened its defences. Mixed with appeasement of extremists since the massacres on 7 October 2023 in Israel, this lack of leadership and absence of moral clarity has led to the upsurge in antisemitism and a sense of chaos, that the mob is in control. Those of us who want to preserve Western and Enlightenment values and restore faith in our institutions have a responsibility to speak up, take action and defend our way of life. That‚Äôs why I stood as an independent candidate in early 2025 in a by-election for the Victorian parliament in the seat of Prahran, the seat I had previously represented as a Labor MP. The Labor Party refused to run in the by-election, so I resigned my life membership of the ALP and ran as an independent to stop the seat being handed to the Greens, which has become an extremist party and isn‚Äôt the environmentalist organisation it once was. This by-election gave me an opportunity to take a stand for the traditional Enlightenment values I believe in and which the Labor Party used to support. My campaign brought together a wonderful group of volunteers, including ALP members and supporters, former parliamentary colleagues, ex-Greens and people who had never been involved in a political campaign before. While not successful in winning the seat myself,¬†I gained a significant vote and my how-to-vote card recommended preferences be directed away from the Greens and to the Liberal Party. Most of my (erstwhile Labor) voters did just that, and as a result of my campaign the Greens were defeated. #auspol #greens",
